As soon as I got well I went to Budapest and in January, 1919 enrolled in the Medical School of the Royal University of Budapest. I also obtained a job with the Gabor Institute, a private school for the problem children of the wealthy. Some of the pupils were backward, some came from broken homes or were unwanted, others were the unmanageable, the kind no other school in the country would take. I was hired to teach mathematics and physical culture after my classes at the University, in exchange for room and board plus a nominal pay. Since jobs were almost impossible to find, it was a most fortunate arrangement.

I did not relish my job. The children were spoiled and in general looked down on their tutors who, as they well knew, came from poorer families.

One of my colleagues, a brilliant chemistry major just about to receive his degree, advised me to be deferential in my relationship with the boys or I wouldn't last long, because Dr. Gabor, the head of the institute, would invariably side with his wealthy pupils in any dispute.

That attitude, as I very soon found out, presented a grave problem in discipline. The boys acted as they pleased, studied or not, behaved in a loud and disrespectful manner. There was a great deal of masturbation in the dormitories, also some evidence of homosexual practices, and the tutors had to be on the lookout for that.

It was quite an ordeal. Attending classes at the University mornings and part of the afternoons, teaching until seven, supervising the dormitories until ten in the evening, then doing my own studying far into the night, was beginning to tax me. I became irritable and took a firm hand with the boys. This was immediately reported to Dr. Gabor who called me on the carpet. He was a pompous man of very short stature with a grotesquely outsize head on his scrawny neck, the largest head I had seen on a man. He censured me severely, stating that unless I learned how to use more tact and diplomacy I would not last long with his institute.

Since I needed the job badly I gave that problem serious study. Most of the trouble originated with the older boys. They were the leaders and the younger ones simply followed their example or even tried to outdo it. The next day I changed the physical culture routine by instituting wrestling. Wrestling was not an accepted form of exercise; it was considered an undignified activity fit only for street urchins. I even added an extra twist—ending the sessions with a controlled free-for-all. Each day I would choose five or six of the most obnoxious boys whom I wanted to see roughed up and set them on each other.

It worked for a while. The boys took to it and I took good care to prevail upon their manly pride to keep them from complaining. They did a far better job of beating each other up than I would have dared to do, yet my standing with the boys improved. All went well until one of my colleagues reported that I was teaching the children ungentlemanly deportment, and Dr. Gabor called me into his office again. He told me curtly to discontinue wrestling at once, impatiently rejecting my argument that the pupils, by then, actually enjoyed it and that it improved their dormitory and classroom behavior. He told me acidly he was not entering into a pedagogic discussion with me, he was telling me what to do. He added ominously that he was too busy that evening but would see me the next day. This disturbed me. I liked my classes at the University; losing my job would present a serious problem.

At ten that evening, after the dormitories were finally in silence, I decided to take a walk. It was against the rules of the Gabor Institute for tutors to go out nights without permission, but since I was in trouble anyway, I did not care.

When I reached Erzsébet Boulevard, that broad thoroughfare usually teeming with life seemed quite deserted and this puzzled me. Although I seldom read the newspapers I knew there was a streetcar strike on—I had had to walk to the University that day. I also knew a printers' strike was on, that no newspapers had been published, and that there was some kind of trouble between the Social-Democrats and Communists.

I knew only in a vague way who the Socialists were, they were the workers in the trade unions. Of the Communists I knew even less. I remembered having read some time back that there were thirty-seven of them, all former prisoners of war who had returned from Russia with a man named Béla Kun who was their leader. Ever since then they had been making trouble for the Social-Democrats. Béla Kun and some of his friends had been arrested and beaten by the police. They were still in jail as far as I knew—not that I cared one way or another. Politics did not interest me, I had my own problems.

I was standing in front of a large café trying to puzzle out why there were so few people around when I saw a straggling line advancing in the center of the deserted boulevard carrying crudely lettered placards which read:

"Long Live the Dictatorship of the Proletariat!"

"Long Live Béla Kun."

The marchers were evidently factory hands, poorly dressed, rather scrawny and underfed. I counted them, there were nineteen, five of them women. I was curious. I went over to the nearest man in the line and fell in step with him. He was an undersized fellow wearing a checkered cap. I asked him what they were doing. He looked me over carefully and then said: "Demonstrating for the proletarian dictatorship." I wanted to know where they were going.

"To the Eastern Railway Depot, to get arms!"

That interested me.

"Why would they give you arms? Have you an authorization?"

"They will have to give them to us, we are in power now. The proletariat in power is armed!" he declaimed.

I became even more interested. I knew what dictatorship was, Sulla in Rome had been a dictator. But I was not quite sure what proletariat meant, although lately I had come across the word frequently in the newspapers, also on some posters. He explained to me. He was a proletarian. He was a factory worker. Proletariat meant all the workers together who had nothing to lose but their chains and the whole world to gain. He said I was not a proletarian, I was a student. When I objected that I was also working, I was tutoring, he said that I was of the intelligentsia. The intelligentsia were not much good, but students were allies. The intelligentsia could be allies, too. I could be a double ally but still no proletarian.

Hearing our conversation a couple of other people moved to my other side so that I was no longer walking on the outside but near the middle of the column. Every time they saw a group of people on the sidewalk they shouted their slogan and so did I—it was fun. They called to the people to join us, but few of them did. Most of them hurried on ahead, some even turned back abruptly.

It was a long march to the Eastern Depot and I got a bit of education. Béla Kun had been released from jail and the Communists and Social Democrats were now the government. Count Mihály Károlyi, President of the Republic, had abdicated and turned the government over to them.

"Who is going to be the president now? Béla Kun?" I asked. That was a childish question. There was to be no president any more, only the proletarian dictatorship which was much better, and Béla Kun was to be the dictator. Everything would be taken away from the rich, who were capitalist exploiters, their factories, land, castles and everything, and divided among the poor. That sounded fine to me but I did not believe it. I asked many other questions but most of the answers were vague. I concluded they were only guessing, they didn't know themselves. After all, they were only ignorant workers. How could they possibly know?

(It took me more than a decade to realize how incredibly wrong I was to feel so superior to them—in attributing their inability to answer my questions clearly to their lack of formal education. They could not possibly have given me the right answers because nobody knew the right answers then. Even in this nuclear age, when the physical survival of all mankind depends on our finding the right answers, those answers are still shrouded in the mist of the future.)

After we reached the Eastern Depot we milled around for quite a while until a couple of the proletarians finally located the railway official who had the key to the arsenal. They surrounded him, argued with him, but he refused to yield until one of the women snatched the huge key ring out of his hand.

It took time to find the right key to fit the lock and to open it. There were no more than a few dozen rifles inside. I looked around for a carbine but there was none, so I took one of the rifles. There was no ammunition in the room. They looked funny, those proletarian men and women carrying their rifles clumsily, like picks and shovels. I was still wearing my old army uniform but with the insignia removed, for I had no civilian clothes. The rifle looked good on me and it also felt good.

After we got ourselves armed nobody knew what to do next, or had any suggestions, so we decided to disperse and go home.

When I got to the gate of the Gabor Institute it was nearly three A.M. I did not care, I was full of animation and not at all sleepy. I rang the bell, not apologetically and gently as usual but hard and loud, enjoying the clangor. After a while I heard Dr. Gabor inside angrily demanding to stop that noise, and wanting to know what was going on. He flung the door open shouting that he'd "teach . . ."

Dr. Gabor glared at me in his long white nightshirt, shouting angrily, how did I dare come in at that hour of the night, waking up the entire school, who gave me permission to go out, on and on.

I just stood there grinning and then brought my rifle smartly off my shoulder. Dr. Gabor's eyes bulged out in his grotesque head. He started to stutter.

"What . . . What . . . What's the meaning of this?"

"Dictatorship of the Proletariat," I grinned. "It just broke out, a couple of hours ago."

He swayed and I had to grab him or he would have fallen. He was one of the leaders of the moderate Liberal Party and, unlike me, he grasped the real meaning of that change in government instantly. The printers' strike had kept him from knowing the latest developments. He was all shaken up and I supported him to his room.

"Good night," he thanked me in a broken voice.

In all the three months I had been working for him that was the first time he addressed me as "Mister"!
<p style="margin-bottom:4em;"></p>

Weeks passed. The Proletarian Dictatorship was developing turbulently yet I was untouched by it. I attended classes, worked in the Institute, studied, rising at six and getting to bed way past midnight, a routine that taxed me to the full leaving me no time or energy to take much interest in the events around me. Occasionally I yearned to share the exciting life some of my colleagues in the University seemed to be leading but no one approached me to draw me in and my time was far too occupied to enable me to seek contacts on my own. I read the newspapers daily but in a superficial way; they were too full of meaningless political jargon and threats against unnamed counterrevolutionary elements to carry much interest for me. I failed to develop sympathy either for or against the Proletarian Dictatorship. Its promises failed to enthuse me; its threats carried no fear for me. The standing slogan displayed on posters everywhere affected me in a reverse way. They showed a steel-helmeted figure with a rifle on his shoulder and a hate-distorted face, pointing a menacing finger at the onlooker and threatening:

"YOU counterrevolutionary slinking in the dark, TREMBLE!"

I would salute the figure, give a mock shudder, wink at him, and depart whistling.

When the Hungarian Soviet Government decreed a general draft of my age group I decided not to obey it and went home to Gyor. This made me a draft evader but I did not care. I was through with the army. My father was worried, however, and asked me to see his friend, Dr. Parányi, a professional army doctor with the rank of major, then automatically serving in the Red Army, to see if he could work out something for me. Dr. Parányi asked me how much medical schooling I had had.

"Four months," I told him sheepishly.

"Splendid!" exclaimed Dr. Dr. Parányi. "I'll make you my assistant." The way he said it, service in the Red Army didn't rate high in his esteem, either.

The next morning he gave me a white coat and introduced me to the comrade medical attendants as the "new doctor," his assistant. I escorted him to sick parade and he instructed me to observe him carefully. There were forty or fifty Red Army soldiers in the line, undressed to the waist. They would enter the office one by one, drop their pants, and recite their ailments. Dr. Parányi would have them open their mouths, stick their tongues out; he would look at the tongue, sometimes look into their throats, then hand them a pill.

Every once in a while he would order a man to turn around, bend down and stretch his cheeks. He would then bend closer, take a look and exclaim triumphantly, "Syphilis." He would then call me over, tell me to take a look at the angry red growth in the anus, and remark proudly he could always detect secondary stage syphilis by a man's general appearance.

After attending sick parade with him for three days Dr. Parányi felt I had sufficient practice to be on my own. He turned medical inspection over to me with instructions to refer the seriously ill to him for treatment in the hospital.

We had only four medications at our disposal. A white pill, calomel, which was a purgative; aspirin, a general cure-all; a gray pill, ipecac, an expectorant and emetic; and a yellow powder, quinine, for fever.

I held sick parades daily, distributing the four medicines according to my judgment and sometimes depending on what supplies we had on hand. When we ran out of one pill I substituted another; it worked out the same. I also tried to diagnose secondary syphilis according to Dr. Parányi's method, by picking a man at random and then taking a look. My score was low. I would mistake scabies, hemorrhoids, or even simple scratches for lues, Dr. Parányi would inform me, sending the men back.

From then on I quit that type of detailed examination. It wasn't aesthetic anyway. I would simply ask every man whether he had or had had syphilis and if the answer was affirmative I would send him to the venereal ward. This improved my score greatly. Dr. Parányi was pleased with my progress and told me I had the makings of a good diagnostician. I accepted that praise with modesty.

One morning when I appeared for my customary sick parade I found no one in line waiting for me. I finally located an attendant who told me that Béla Kun had resigned, the Soviet Dictatorship was over, that all the men, including the ward patients, had miraculously recovered and left for home.

I went home, too.

It did not affect me one way or another.

After the fall of the Proletarian Dictatorship a number of workers were arrested. Since I did not know any of them that made little impression on me at first because neither I nor my family or friends were involved in any way. But when Admiral Horthy's White Army entered my town and the White Terror began in earnest my outlook changed completely.

Gangs wearing white armbands roamed the streets dragging people off trains, out of their homes, or off their jobs on the merest suspicion of having been involved in Communistic, Social Democratic, or trade union activities, then brutally torturing, even murdering them. One young boy whom I knew personally had been taken to a concentration camp merely because he had joined the Cabinet Makers Union, although in that shop it was compulsory for all apprentices to join. When he was released four months later he was a cripple and it was said he had been castrated. I went to see him and he sobbed that it was true. He was then sixteen years old.

The Horthy régime needed a scapegoat and, as usual in history, we Jews became it. We were being called unscrupulous finance capitalist exploiters and also Communists, both at the same time. We were accused of being responsible for the loss of the war; also for all the miseries suffered by the people because of the centuries-old feudal oppression. Anti-Semitism became the official policy of the government and Parliament was debating proposals ranging from the complete extermination of the Jews to the comparatively mild one of barring them from all jobs and professions and expropriating their property.

In Gyor the <em>Catholic Herald</em> appeared under the standing banner headline:
<p style="text-align:center;">WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? LET'S SETTLE WITH THE JEWS!</p>

My father, who had received several offers before the war to go to the United States and another one right after the war, finally decided to pull up roots. The family emigrated to the United States in the fall of 1920. I stayed behind to finish medical school but that proved impossible.

Bands of young hoodlums armed with clubs, brass knuckles, and <em>bikacsek</em> (the Hungarian version of a blackjack, made of the carefully desiccated genitals of a bull), would burst into the classrooms of the University, demanding that each student stand up and "identify" himself.

This "identification" was not a request for the showing of documents. It called for each male student to drop his trousers and expose his genitals for inspection, disregarding the presence of girl students. All those circumcised were then identified as Jews even though many had medical proof to the contrary, and they were mercilessly beaten by the thugs, mainly on their heads and genitals, crippling many of them for life.

In my classes a large group of us, including many non-Jewish colleagues, got together and armed ourselves with short lengths of lead pipe and with brass weights appropriated from grocers' scales. When these roving bands would hit our own classroom, we would give battle royal. Desks would be overturned, chairs smashed, precious instruments destroyed, floors and walls splattered with blood. Our example spread to other classrooms, and finally the University had to be closed down and all classes abandoned.

I went back to Gyor and spent my days in corroding idleness, staying in bed all morning and playing cards in the afternoon, until I felt my muscles grow flabby and my mind empty. To hell with becoming a doctor, I concluded, sold the family furniture, and booked passage to America.

I arrived in New York on July 1, 1921, and by the next day I had a job in a fur shop as a combination sweep-up man and errand boy. In Hungary I would sooner have starved than take such a humiliating job, akin to that of a stable boy, but here I was happy and proud. This was a republic and a democracy where each man was free and equal. This is where I belonged!

Two days later a startling sound of explosions woke me out of my sleep. I listened intently, the firing seemed to have spread all over the city. I distinguished not only single shots but also a short burst of a machine gun in action. So it had reached even the United States! The revolution had come to New York.

I threw my clothes on hurriedly and rushed out, wondering where could I get hold of a carbine. The streets were deserted, the stores, usually open by that time, were all closed. It was the revolution all right. There was nobody around except children. Naturally, there was no use asking them, they couldn't know. The firing sounded quite close and it was coming closer still.

I was making my way toward the subway station when I saw a man emerging from there. I rushed over to him and asked him what was happening. He looked at me in obvious puzzlement, uneasy over my anxiety. I repeated my question very slowly to make sure he understood my heavily accented English and asked him where the main fighting was, what the revolution was about? He still did not comprehend. Just then there was a loud explosion right behind me and it made me jump.

"Didn't you hear that?" I yelled, exasperated.

He looked at me, then threw his head back and roared, just roared with laughter.

It was the Fourth of July celebration.
