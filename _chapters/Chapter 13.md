Working in the fur shop was exciting. It was a sweatshop but I did not know that then. I worked a seventy-two hour, six-day week. My working day started at seven o'clock in the morning. The boss would come in ahead of me and after unhooking the Holmes Burglar Alarm System he would lay out the work. When I came in at seven, I would sweep the place and wet the skins for the cutters. The men started at eight, quit at five. Afterward I finished up after them, did whatever the boss told me to do, and left some time after seven in the evening. The boss would leave with me unless something went wrong with the Holmes system, which happened often. In that event, we would have to stay and wait until the Holmes men came, checked, and mended the break. Often that took until eight or later. On Saturdays the shop would close down at twelve but the boss and I would stay on. He liked to stay late and always found enough for me to do.

My pay was $12 a week. My parents lived in Philadelphia then and I had taken a furnished room in New York with my cousin. He had arrived in America a few months ahead of me and he was also working in a fur shop, making the same money as I did. My uncle was a skin dealer and he had found his job for him also.

We each paid four dollars a week for the room. Sixty cents of our pay went for carfare, $1.05 for cigarettes, $1.oo for laundry. That left us each $5.35 a week for food and all our other expenses. It worked out to 76 cents per day, 79 cents for Sunday, a holiday. It was very little, but we managed.

Breakfast came to ten cents for a cup of coffee and two hard rolls. After a while we discovered a place where the cups were larger and the rolls the size of a fist.

For lunch I would go to Max's Busy Bee on Sixth Avenue, right around the corner from the shop. They served a big fat hamburger on a big roll for five cents, which included the gravy. I did not ask what kind of meat they used. The burgers were big, the gravy was heavy, and I was always very hungry. I would have two of these hamburgers and a sweet roll with a dab of pink jelly on top. That feast set me back thirteen cents each day, but I considered it well worth the price. It was at Max's Busy Bee that I first discovered how inadequate was the conversational English I had taught myself from books before coming to America. I would ask the people standing at the counter alongside of me: "May I bother you for the salt cellar?" and they would just stare, uncomprehending. My cousin who was learning his English here finally told me how to say it in American.

"Gimme de salt," he taught me. He was a good teacher. I had no more such troubles.

For dinner, my cousin and I would usually splurge. We would buy two quarts of milk, two stale loaves of bread, and two full pounds of liverwurst, the cheapest meat by far and most delicious. That dinner would come to 3 cents each, leaving us with a surplus of eighteen cents daily for luxuries such as an occasional banana, for cultural needs such as a newspaper, or to be saved up for emergencies such as buying razor blades or handkerchiefs.

I usually went through my entire pay but my cousin managed to save part of his. By the end of three weeks he had accumulated considerable capital. He wouldn't tell me how much but I suspected he had at least three dollars saved up. I envied him and made bitter reproaches to myself for being a wastrel, too self-indulgent for my own good. I knew I needed self-discipline and made resolve after resolve not to be such a spendthrift but I simply lacked the necessary firmness of character.

Of course, from time to time certain complicated borderline cases would arise that made it difficult to decide what was the more economical practice to follow in this puzzling land. Take the case of the handkerchiefs.

The air in all fur shops is full of flying hairs, a constant irritant to nostrils unaccustomed to it, as ours were, necessitating the use of an unusually large number of handkerchiefs. Our landlady did not allow us to wash them in our room and the laundry charged four cents apiece. So far, all good and well.

However, peddlers would come around the fur market selling handkerchiefs for five cents each, six for a quarter. This posed a real dilemma. Laundering six soiled handkerchiefs cost twentyfour cents, while here were six brand new handkerchiefs for twenty-five cents, costing only a penny more. What was the economically sounder practice?

My cousin decided to continue to have his laundered. A penny saved was a penny earned, a bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.

To me, the latter analogue rested on a false premise. Birds fly away but handkerchiefs were solid, tangible objects which once bought became personal property, i.e., wealth. I decided on the long-range capital gain, buy new ones, save up the soiled.

Life proved my cousin right. Months later when we decided to move from that place, I found my suitcases filled to overflowing with brand new but soiled handkerchiefs. It was either pack them or my clothes. One or the other had to be left behind, and of course the clothes won out. My capital accumulation was wiped out at one fell swoopâ€”my first painful experience with that economic phenomenon termed "business cycle." My cousin who was secretly worried about my daily rising stock of handkerchiefs, now showed open relief. He was gracious enough to console me, however, by explaining:

"One day you're up, the next day you're down. That's America."
