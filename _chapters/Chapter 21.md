title: Chapter 21
---

Mention the year 1929 to anyone familiar with the history of the twenties and he will immediately think of it as the black year of the stock market crash in October. But this was still summer, one of those beautiful lazy Saturdays which brings songs or at least a gay whistle to the lips. I rose late, made my breakfast, and leafed leisurely through the morning paper. A small news item caught my casual attention. It stated that beginning at midnight, according to an announcement by the Bell Telephone Company, regular transatlantic telephone service would be instituted between France and the United States. The call to France could be made from any regular phone in the United States and the price for a three-minute telephone conversation was given as seventy-five dollars.

For some unaccountable reason this little item pleased me as if I had been handed an unexpected little present. I cast an affectionate glance in the direction of my private phone which I treasured as a mark of personal achievement. To me that private phone signaled the end to those furnished-room days when the landlady would yell up from the bottom of the stairwell, "Hey, there's a phone call for you." It meant the last of those suspenseful moments I had experienced every time the phone rang downstairs, the anxious search for a nickel before I could put a call through. This was my very own private phone; when it rang it was for me! That item made me gaze even more fondly at my phone, practically telling him, fellow, you don't know it, but beginning at midnight anyone can pick up a receiver just like yours and talk straight to Paris.

Over my second cup of coffee I wondered what kind of a man would want to talk to Paris badly enough to throw away seventy-five dollars for that whim. What a thrill it would be to call up someone in Paris out of a clear blue sky. "What's the charge, operator, seventy-five dollars? That's all right, put him on." And then my thoughts wandered off to wherever such fancies fade away.

Further back in the paper I came across another brief item which stated that Count Mihály Károlyi, former and first President of Hungary, his visa difficulties smoothed out with the State Department, would visit the United States to go on a lecture tour for a well-known New York lecture bureau.

I was glad to hear that Károlyi had finally received permission to enter the United States. I made a mental note to attend his lecture and perhaps find a way for a personal visit with him. I wanted to learn more about the 1918 October revolution from him for my play.

I spent the rest of that day in a manner befitting that balmy Saturday. I walked to Central Park, took a ride on top of the Fifth Avenue bus, and decided to top off the evening by having dinner at the Hungarian Workers' Home Restaurant and talk some Hunky for a change.

As I entered the crowded restaurant fragrant with the spicy odor of goulash, stuffed cabbage, and chicken paprikash, I noticed Kovess, Balint, and Hugo Gellert in an excited and what even appeared to be a conspiratorial huddle over a table farthest in back. They were sitting right under one of Hugo's cubistic, violently red and blue-green murals. There was no food on their red-checked tablecloth. They were not dining, they were having a meeting. I waved hello to them and was about to seat myself at another table when they called me over.

It was an emergency meeting. Kovess was very agitated, Hugo was pale and nervous, and the usually witty Balint looked solemn and serious. Their discussion was about Károlyi's forthcoming visit. They felt themselves betrayed. I didn't know why, so I inquired.

There seemed to be quite a few angles to it.

Count Károlyi who had been vacationing in France in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War and who had been subsequently interned by the French, had opposed Hungary's entry into the war from the start. In 1916, when the French finally released him, he came to the United States to rally the Hungarians to his cause. His liberal views, his advocacy of land reform and redistribution of the land---all these coming from a Count, one of the richest members of the old Hungarian aristocracy, made him an idolized figure among the Hungarian immigrants, mostly former peasants now working in the mines and mills of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, etc. Old mustachioed Hungarians openly wept, women kissed his hands and the hem of his garment, and they donated over $Ioo,ooo to a Károlyi Fund for land reform. Subsequently, when the United States entered the War against the Central Powers in 1917, this Fund was frozen here by the government.

After Horthy seized power in 1919, Count Károlyi went into exile in Paris where he drifted closer and closer to Communism by maintaining contact with Béla Kun in Moscow and the Hungarian Communist Bureau in Paris. Although he was not an actual Communist Party member, Károlyi had become such a close sympathizer that he had submitted himself to Communist Party discipline.

Kovess, a man of bold imagination, had tried to bring Károlyi over here for another tour to build up the Anti-Horthy League and the Communist Party. Károlyi had been willing, but when he attempted to enter the United States in 1927 he was refused a visa and turned back at Ellis Island. Hence the announcement in that day's <em>Times</em> came as a bombshell to Kovess. Károlyi had evidently now received an entry permit and was coming here, not for the Hungarian Bureau but to lecture in English to American audiences, under the auspices of an American lecture bureau! That was an outrage, a betrayal of the Hungarian revolution.

"We will break up every one of his lectures," Kovess vowed. I was amazed at that attitude. Károlyi certainly did not deserve that kind of hostile treatment. Why not let the Count finish his scheduled lecture tour in English and then be asked to go on a Hungarian tour for the Anti-Horthy League, I suggested.

Hugo seemed to agree but Balint dismissed my idea with a wave of his hand, intolerant of my "political ignorance."

"That would be like sending a whore down from the officers' bordello to the enlisted men after the officers got all the juice out of her." Balint was fond of military allusions.

"We can't have him second-hand," Kovess objected. "He wouldn't draw the crowds---the novelty of his presence would be worn off by then."

I persisted. I argued that Károlyi's lectures in English before American audiences would not detract from his appeal to exclusively Hungarian audiences later.

My stand made no impression on Kovess. He kept insisting that Károlyi would have to lecture for us first, or be prevented from lecturing at all. Hugo Gellert now also came to Károlyi's defense. They were personal friends; he had spent considerable time in Krolyi's company on his last visit to France.

"I believe Count Károlyi is not fully aware of the political implications of that lecture tour," Hugo asserted. He suggested we send the Count a letter at once explaining the situation and asking him to lecture for us instead.

"Your observation is sound but your accompanying suggestion is not," Kovess reprimanded Gellert. It would take two weeks or more for a letter to reach Károlyi and another two or three weeks to receive a reply. Besides, it took time to organize a successful Hungarian tour. Taking the matter up with Károlyi by cable was also ruled out by Kovess on the grounds of needed secrecy.

Hugo had another suggestion. He proposed to drop his work and sail to Paris immediately if the fare for his passage could be raised. We looked expectantly at Balint who then proceeded to give us a treasurer's report on the current fiscal status of the Anti-Horthy League. The League had a minus balance of $28 in cash, money paid by Balint out of his own pocket for current expenses, plus a couple of hundred dollars of other negative assets, such as long overdue printers' bills, etc. Kovess next reported that the Hungarian Bureau was equally flat broke, he hadn't collected his $15 a week salary for over a month. He had been living on short rations.

It was a dark, insoluble problem when I suddenly had my inspiration!

"Why not call up Károlyi?" I suggested.

They all looked at me as if I had gone insane.

"Call him up? He is still in Paris!"

"Sure, call him up in Paris." I enjoyed my triumph. "Right one second after midnight." And I explained it to them. That changed the entire aspect. They were greatly excited. The problem then boiled down to one question: Where could we get hold of $75 cash? I had twenty-odd dollars on me, Balint had about ten, Hugo two and Kovess some small change. We next explored the possibilities of borrowing that seventy-five dollars until Monday. They were nil. Then another inspiration hit me. I was sparkling that night.

"Why not make the call from my phone? That would give us time until next month to pay the bill." This idea was accepted with enthusiasm. I may have been politically naive and inexperienced but I certainly proved to be a reservoir of decisive practical proposals. We agreed to split the cost of that phone call among the three of us, Hugo, Balint, and myself, each contributing $25. Kovess also offered to chip in five dollars but we turned him down. He protested, although he knew he couldn't raise that five dollars, and so did we.

We repaired to my apartment in a state of great elation. I was particularly exultant over the juxtaposition of those two small news items. I could never put such an incident into a play, I mused, no such coincidence would be accepted by the critics.

In the apartment we all sat down with pencil and paper, planning. The problem, as outlined by Kovess, was twofold.

First, we had to formulate our plans and proposals so clearly that Károlyi could not possibly misunderstand them; secondly, we had to boil our message down not only to fit into the allotted three minutes but also to allow Károlyi sufficient time for his reply.

It was not easy, although we had a couple of hours for it. According to Hugo, Count Károlyi had a strict, never-varying routine. He would get up at seven, shave, shower, get dressed, bring in the morning papers and sit down to breakfast precisely at the stroke of eight. Consequently, taking the five hours time difference into consideration we decided to make the call at 3:00 A.M. sharp, New York time.

We worked away in deep concentration, discarding draft after draft as being too long. Kovess then announced that we should divide the call into five distinct parts. One minute for our message, forty seconds for Károlyi's answer, thirty seconds for our second argument, twenty seconds for Károlyi's second reply, ten seconds to be held in reserve for emergency, in case Kovess had to invoke party discipline to force Károlyi to conform.

That was precision planning, my first chance to witness the superiority of Communist organization, to observe a Communist Party leader in action. Everything foreseen by the scientific method of dialectical materialism, split-second provision for all possible emergencies! I could now see why the Communists had a valid claim on the future. I was awed.

It was superior organization and with four excellent brains working in brilliant co-ordination we had the problem eventually licked. We cut and cut, formulated and reformulated, evaluated and re-evaluated, phrased and rephrased, until we arrived at the irreducible which was yet crystal clear in meaning and purpose. Kovess then read the text aloud to Hugo. Hugo was to do the actual talking because Károlyi knew him personally and thus he would not doubt the authenticity of our proposal.

We sat in suspense while we timed it.

"Hallo! Count Károlyi? This is Hugo Gellert speaking in the name of the Anti-Horthy League and the Hungarian Bureau. Now that you evidently have your American visa we insist that you cancel your scheduled lecture engagements and go on tour for us. We guarantee a mass audience of over two hundred thousand Hungarians. You will speak in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, etc., etc."

Kovess read it rapidly, but it still took one minute and forty-three seconds---far too long. More cuts were needed and we fell to it at once.

We cut out "Hallo"; this was no time for formal greetings. We cut out "Hugo" for Károlyi knew what Gellert's first name was. We cut out "speaking," it would be evident that Gellert was speaking, Károlyi wouldn't hear him otherwise. Out of the phrase "Now that you evidently have your American visa" we cut "now," for Károlyi would know we were referring to the present. Cutting out "now" automatically eliminated "that" because then it would have referred to nothing. We eliminated "American": since we would be calling from New York, Károlyi ought to be able to deduce the reference was to America, and so on down the line. It was a severely tasking effort of excision, the editors of the digest magazines would have applauded our determination.

Kovess now read it out loud again. By racing through it, he made it in 58 seconds flat with two precious seconds to spare.

We were jubilant. I turned the script over to Hugo to read it over to himself a few times, and when ready, I would time him.

When Hugo began to read out loud we turned pale. Hugo was slow of speech and as he plodded on in his slow drawl the speech seemed to stretch into eternity. It took him one minute and fifty-five seconds to finish-a catastrophe. It was impossible to cut that message any further without loss of clarity.

In desperation I set myself to coach Hugo in his delivery. Kovess and Balint were hanging on each word, their lips moving silently with Hugo's. All I managed to achieve was to bring him down to one minute forty seconds. It wasn't nearly enough. He had to speed it up more.

I asked Hugo to read it over again, to stress his consonants, which would compensate for slurring his words and thus gain time. He tried it. Kovess and Balint were leaning forward, their eyes glued to Hugo's lips, practically pulling the words out of his mouth. Hugo was laboring under a strain. He became more and more nervous, his face became flushed, beads of perspiration appeared on his brow. Suddenly, without any warning, he went into a stammer.

"The Anti-Ho . . . Ho . . . Hoho . . . Hohoho . . .  Horthy Lllllll . . . Li . . . Lll . . . It was no use---he had the stutters, all right. We had no alternative but to let him rest for a while.

Hugo did not touch liquor so all I could offer him was water. There was nothing we could do but sit it out. After a few minutes' wait Kovess wanted Hugo to try again but I demurred, it might have brought on another attack of stutters. We agreed instead to let Hugo speak in his normal delivery, allowing him all the time he needed, and to omit the rebuttal and re-rebuttal. Let Hugo take his one minute and forty seconds and close with:

"You have one minute and twenty seconds to reply."

Time was passing rapidly. At ten minutes to three I called the operator again to remind her that we wanted the call to Count Károlyi put through at exactly three in the morning. A few minutes later the operator reported back that the lines were clear and she expected the call to go through as scheduled.

Zero hour, three o'clock, was rapidly approaching. We were sitting in a tight circle, leaning forward to the phone, our eyes glued to the second hand of my watch; the clicking of each second sounded staccato loud in the room. When the phone rang we all jumped and four hands grabbed for the receiver. We recovered in time to let Hugo lift it.

"Ready with your call to Paris, sir?" asked the operator.

Four heads nodded in silent assent.

The operator couldn't see that.

"Ready with your call to Paris, sir?" asked the operator again, with a slight edge in her tone.

"Yes, operator!" we shouted in chorus. It burst forth in a roar, we had each found our voices at the same time.

"Thank you!" said the operator and we heard her converse with the operator in Paris. We were so close to the phone that our noses nearly touched. The phone in Paris rang. Then rang again.

No one seemed to be answering. Our tension mounted. The phone rang twice again and then we heard the receiver lifted.

"Hallo" came over the wire and it was Károlyi, we recognized instantly the characteristic impediment in his speech. Four pent-up breaths escaped whistling into the air.

"Hallo" came Károlyi's voice again over the phone. "Who is there? Who is calling?"

This wasn't on our schedule. We nudged Hugo, who swallowed and then began to read his speech.

"Count Károlyi, this is Gellert speaking in the name of the . . ."

"Just a minute please," interrupted the Count. "Hold on just a minute. I just ran out of the shower when I heard the phone ring. I am dripping all over the floor. Hold the line please while I get a towel." The connection was terrific. We even heard him shuffle off.

This was definitely not according to the schedule. We glared at Hugo. "The Count with his never-varying schedule!" The paper was trembling in Hugo's hands.

My watch was ticking away at 41.5 cents per second. Kovess grabbed the script out of Hugo's hands and made a lightning quick correction. It now read: "You have 52 seconds to answer."

The Count came back to the phone and said, "Who is this calling please?"

Hugo started all over again from the beginning.

"This is Gellert speaking in the name of the . . ."

"Who?" shouted the Count.

"Gellert," Hugo shouted back.

"Gellert?" asked the Count puzzled. "Gellert who?"

"Gellert, Gellert. Hugo Gellert," said Hugo, desperately urging recognition.

"Hugo Gellert!" the Count shouted happily. "Hallo Hugo, when did you arrive in Paris?"

"I am not in Paris," said Hugo. "I am in New York."

"In New York? How can you talk to me then if you are in New York?" The Count was both puzzled and incredulous.

"Over the phone," said Hugo.

"Over the phone? From New York?" the astonished Count repeated.

"Yes," said Hugo.

"Amazing," commented Károlyi. "Imagine, over the phone, from New York! Can you hear me?" It suddenly occurred to him.

"Yes, I can," said Hugo, by now completely befuddled.

"I can hear you, too," verified the Count. "What time is it in New York?"

"Three in the morning," said Hugo.

"It's eight in the morning herein Paris," said the Count. "It's the difference in time, you know," he added for clarification "Is it raining there too?"

"No, it's not raining here," said Hugo. "Is it raining hard over there?" By now Hugo too had become infected with the Count's delight in light conversation.

This was a rout. We were paralyzed, unable to breathe.

"No, it isn't much of a rain," the Count assured Hugo. "It may let up any minute. Wait, I'll take a look." We heard his footsteps depart and a door being opened.

"The speech, the speech, read him the speech," Kovess hissed to Hugo, pointing to the paper in his hands.

We heard the footsteps returning and the Count picked up the receiver.

"It's still raining outside, but it may soon stop. Again, it may not," he qualified, a statesman unwilling to commit himself.

I glanced at my watch, then held it up for the others to see.

Three minutes and eight seconds had already passed. We watched the second hand race on in mute horror.

Finally Gellert managed to get down to business and read the message, including the final part, "You now have 40 seconds to answer." Kovess had had the presence of mind to cut it down again.

"Hmmm..." mused Károlyi, "I can't do that, Hugo. I am under signed contract to that lecture bureau, you know. I cannot lecture in America for anyone but them. You know what, they are even paying my passage," he exclaimed with delight.

"Tell him that he must, he must," Kovess urged Hugo frantically, "tell him it is a Party decision that he must." Hugo tried but he wasn't successful. The Count would hardly let him put in a word, he wanted to do the talking. "Write me a letter," he finally concluded, "and I'll explain it to you more fully in my reply."

Suddenly a last thought occurred to him.

"Hugo, we shouldn't discuss this over the phone," he admonished. "You may not be aware of it but a call to Paris must cost money, you know." He hung up.

We were aware of it. His weather forecast alone concerning that slight rain in Paris, inconclusive as such amateur forecasts usually are, cost over eight dollars and sixty-seven and a half cents. When the phone bill finally came it was for $189.55. Balint paid me his $25. Hugo was broke, so he owed me his. Kovess never reopened his bid to pay the five bucks and that was that.

My curiosity as to what kind of a man would actually want to call Paris and pay $25 a minute for the privilege had been fully satisfied.

Eventually, enough money was raised by Bureau to send Hugo Gellert to Paris to deal with the Count in person. He wasn't altogether successful. The lecture agency had threatened an injunction to prevent the Count from speaking anywhere in the United States except under its auspices. Finally a compromise solution was reached. The Count would finish his lecture tour and then speak in a few selected towns for the Anti-Horthy League. When Károlyi gave his first lecture in Carnegie Hall Kovess had thought fit to teach him a lesson anyway, to warn him and to impress on him the consequences of breaching Party discipline. He had a number of Communists planted in the hall who caused quite a disturbance, embarrassing the Count and frightening the audience.

On his tour for the Anti-Horthy League Károlyi did draw large audiences but nowhere near the crowds Kovess had anticipated. Organizationally the tour was a flop, with very few members joined, and the League remained a paper creation. Later it changed its name to "Hungarian Anti-Fascist League" to add its weight of a feather and its nonexistent prestige to another Communist front organization, the League Against War and Fascism.

Kovess did succeed, however, in his secret objective, which at the time of that phone call had been carefully hidden from me, and which was the actual motivating force behind all that effort. With Károlyi here in person the Communist Party was able to set into motion that necessary legal machinery which eventually succeeded in unfreezing the Károlyi Fund which by that time, with interest, had grown to well over $150,000. It was a shady kind of deal involving bribery and whatnot, and there were too many hands in it, including that of the Central Committee of the Party. The fight over the division of that loot was finally settled by Béla Kun and the Comintern in Moscow. Károlyi personally did not take a cent of it, the lion's share went to the Comintern and to the Central Committee of the American Communist Party. After it was all divided up and the expenses deducted, the share of the Hungarian Bureau and <em>Uj Elore</em> together was far below the figure Kovess had dreamed about; it came to less than $19,000. Louis Bebrits, editor of the <em>Uj Elore</em>, challenged even that figure when I discussed it with him later. I could never verify the actual amount even when I became manager of the <em>Uj Elore</em>, for the movement never kept records of such transactions.

Just before Károlyi departed from America I managed to spend an evening with him in his suite in a downtown Fifth Avenue hotel, the Brevoort, I believe. I found him a most charming and gracious patrician, a statesman and a patriot, a leader who automatically commanded loyalty. When we discussed the 1918 October revolution he admitted that even though he had firmly believed that the monarchy was a tottering corpse which would fall apart at the first real challenge, neither he nor his associates ever dreamed that it would disintegrate so rapidly under its own dead weight. They were completely confounded when the October revolution came to pass bloodlessly.

I told him about the Kobanya incident, how we had marched out to shoot down the revolution, and, had we been given that order, we would have fired unhesitatingly and accurately to kill.

Károlyi recalled that incident.

"I am glad you did not have to shoot," he smiled at me.

Twelve years had passed since then. Time brings many changes. I was glad, too, by then. Very glad!
