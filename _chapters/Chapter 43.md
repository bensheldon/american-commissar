title: Chapter 43

We arrived in Albacete in the early morning after another sleepless, overcrowded night's ride. We were marched to an enormous army building, the <em>Guardia Nacionale</em>. We must have been around six hundred, close to a hundred of us Americans. We were told to form up by nationalities, and have our pictures taken for our <em>livret militaire</em>, our military book. I still have mine. That photo shows a haggard, deeply lined face drugged by going five nights with only snatches of sleep, the eyelids heavy with the effort of staying open.

A snatch of Hungarian conversation aroused me from my stupor. A smartly uniformed man was talking in Hungarian to another soldier who was obviously his subordinate—his uniform was shapeless and faded.

"Are you comrades Hungarians?" I went to them, eager to strike up acquaintance with veterans who were from the old country.

They turned and looked me over. The smartly uniformed one seemed undersized and wore an officer's cap with two short golden bars in two parallel rows above the black visor. His tunic was tailor-made and padded, it made him appear far broader in chest than his scrawny neck and pinched face warranted. He was around twenty-eight or thirty, his mouth set in the stern lines of authority Hungarians seem to thrive on—an expression I hadn't seen since I had left Hungary. The other man seemed to be some kind of an army clerk whose obsequious attitude struck a wrong chord in me.

The officer regarded me with baleful eyes.

"Didn't you hear me call that all Hungarians should step over there?" He pointed to a corner where three men, obviously new arrivals, were standing. "Or do you think I ought to extend a special invitation to you, engraved perhaps?"

The good old Hungarian cock of the walk! I remembered his type but had not expected to meet up with it here in Spain.

"Just who are you, comrade?" I asked, a bit uneasy.

"I am First Lieutenant Szasz, the base commander of the Hungarians," he informed me curtly. "Now get over there with the other Hungarians, double step!" he commanded.

I did not expect that development. It took me years of inner party struggle to get out of the Hungarian movement in America and now I was being ordered right back. Joining the Hungarians, to serve under such bastards, was the least of my intentions.

"I am an American, comrade," I explained.

"Don't talk back to me!" he snapped. "You speak Hungarian, you are a Hungarian. We don't care where you come from, all Hungarians belong to us."

I became uneasy, also resentful. What was I, a chattel? By what right does he think he owns me?

"You have the wrong man, comrade. I am an American citizen, my place is with the Americans."

"We have jurisdiction over all Hungarians."

"Not over me."

"Keep your mouth shut! I'll teach you to show respect. Get over there with the other Hungarians at once!" He shouted, purple with anger.

I must still have had some Hungarian left in me at that, for I automatically responded with a string of choice Hungarian oaths mostly about his mother, then turned and walked away.

He ran after me and grabbed me by the arm.

"I'll make you pay for this! You're under arrest! <em>Guardia! Guardia!</em>" he yelled.

I wrenched my arm free. By that time we were attracting considerable attention. Other Americans came over, asking worriedly what was up, what did that monkey want of me? A French guard with rifle on his shoulder sauntered over and Szasz ordered him in French to call the commander of the guard.

Szasz was threatening me in the meantime, swearing he would teach me what anti-Fascist discipline was, that he'd show me that the International Brigades were no haven for scum and lumpen-proletarians until the commander of the guard finally arrived. He was also French, the golden stripes on his crushed cap set awry on his head indicating that he was an officer, for no one would have guessed it otherwise. He was sloppy. His faded blue shirt was unbuttoned exposing his hairy chest; the fly of his unpressed, wrinkled pants was open; the belt girdling his bulging fat stomach hung loosely buckled. He was unshaven and unwashed, he was picking his teeth and belching. I realized I had to play it carefully and listened intently as Szasz spoke to him in rapid French pointing to that group of three newly arrived Hungarians waiting at the side and then back to me. Finally the commander turned to me, scratching his stomach.

"What do you say?" he said in French, without too much interest. From the tone of his voice he wasn't too impressed with Szasz.

"<em>Merde! Je suis un Americaine</em>," I said with a show of outrage. "Non-Hongroise," I added, showing him my passport, cursing loud in English.

The commander of the guard took my passport, glanced at it and gave it back to me. He then shrugged his shoulders and threw up his hands to Szasz in the inimitable French gesture, belched, and moved away. I told the beet-red Szasz he made me ashamed to have been born a Hungarian and walked away myself.

Well, I had just come through my first battle in Spain. I wasn't happy over it. Evidently the Fascists I had come to fight were not all on the other side.
