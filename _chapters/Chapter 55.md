The bright hopes raised by our successful offensive in recrossing the Ebro did not last long. The Spanish Loyalist Government lacked arms, supplies, trained manpower to exploit our initial success, and our advance soon bogged down. That offensive bled the Internationals white; we no longer had any manpower left to supply even the steel frame which kept our brigades together. Our usefulness as shock troops for the Loyalist Army was irrevocably past.

Recognizing this practical state of affairs Prime Minister Juan Negrin resorted to a master stroke. He publicly declared before the <em>Cortez</em> on September 21, 1938, that all Internationals on the Loyalist side would be withdrawn from the front at once and sent out of Spain as rapidly as arrangements could be made with other countries to admit them. In turn he asked that the Non-Intervention Committee compel Franco also to withdraw the Italian and Nazi troops fighting on his side—to let Spain decide her own fate without the aid of foreign interventionists.

It was a noble gesture although a rather feeble one and the Fascists knew it. By that time the number of all internationals in Loyalist Spain was way under 8,000. Of the over-all number of 50,000 Internationals who had gone to Spain, two out of every three or about 35,000 of them had been killed in battle or  succumbed to their wounds later.

Hitler and Mussolini cynically responded by announcing they too, would withdraw their forces, but man for man—one Fascist for each International, or a total of 8,000 out of their 200,000 foreign Fascist troops.

Shortly afterward I was summoned to Barcelona by Inspector General Luigi Gallo, Marty's deputy (at this writing the head of the Communist version of Hitler's storm troopers in Italy), to take over the editorship of the final issues of the <em>Volunteer for Liberty</em>. I objected to that assignment and proposed someone else in my place; I had had my fill of Party propaganda.

I was overruled. As it transpired the editorship of the <em>Volunteer for Liberty</em> was to be only an incidental part of my duties. I was wanted mainly to help complete the historical record of the International Brigades, that old assignment I had forgotten.

In the ensuing weeks, from the time of my transfer to Barcelona until the XV Brigade was formally disbanded, I only visited the Brigade twice, both times by official invitation; the first one proved highly distasteful, the second most depressing.

The first visit was at the urgent request of John Gates, transmitted by courier, but giving no reason for it. Although puzzled, I welcomed the excuse to get away from under the despotic eyes of Marty in Barcelona if even for a day or two.

When I entered headquarters I found Gates, that once modest and indifferently dressed young comrade whom I knew to be a nonsmoker now sporting a fancy tailored uniform, topped off with the highest officer's cap ever displayed in Spain. He was puffing on a fat, expensive imported cigar, sprawled back with his feet on his desk. When he saw me enter he swaggered over and instead of instead of shaking hands he started to roar at me that I was in trouble, that I didn't know him well if I thought he would let me get away with it, that he'd have me court-martialed and so on. I was stunned; I had not the least idea what he was talking about until he finally bellowed at me, he wanted me. to hand back at once the funds that belonged to the Commissariat,
did I actually think he would let me get away with it?

I still did not comprehend it. That money had been deposited with the brigade's financial officer for safekeeping, all except an the small petty cash that was handled by my clerk, José Civéra, an honest and trustworthy Spanish comrade. I had made a note of all that and given it to Dave Gordon to turn over to Gates because I had to hurry to catch my transport for Barcelona;  Gordon knew that I had deposited that money. I told that to
Gates but he was unbelieving.

We called in Dave Gordon. At first he disclaimed knowing anything about it, but after I hammered away at him he admitted I might have told him about the deposit and he might have forgotten to mention it to Gates but flatly denied having received that note. I recognized Dave Gordon's fine knife technique in that; he was going back to Ohio with a rather questionable record and had hoped to pull me down with him.

The brigade finance office was far away, it took more than two hours to locate the finance officer. I had never felt such acute distress even in the tightest situation in the field. I was in a perfect spot for a frame; in the Party the accusation of embezzlement is the first step to political liquidation, in Spain to physical liquidation as well.

The finance officer acknowledged having that money on deposit with him, every centavo of it. It was a considerable sum, as I recollect it, most of it the accumulation of the pay of those killed in battle whom the commissars would not report dead so their pay could be collected to swell the party's political fund, thus defrauding the Loyalist Government.

That put Gates in an embarrassing situation. At one time he might have apologized for such unwarranted behavior toward an old comrade but now he was Brigade Commissar; a party leader is infallible, he can't admit to mistakes. He tried to justify his attitude by blustering that I should have asked him for authorization before depositing the political funds with the military where it might be sequestered. I retorted since I was responsible for that money it was natural for me not to want to risk losing it by carrying it with me into battle.

On my way back to Barcelona I wondered why a rise in rank should so greatly change a Communist for the worse, turn even that once-modest young man into a swaggering autocrat? I attributed it to character deficiency in Gates and to his overwhelming vanity which I myself had helped to nourish by writing a few flattering articles about him. I wasn't astute enough to realize that the major part of the blame rested with the totalitarian structure of the party. In a democracy the exercise of power is circumscribed and limited by law. In totalitarian societies, the leaders are the law and therefore their power is absolute. Of course they too share the risk of running afoul of someone higher up whose power over them in turn is again absolute—retroactively so, as many Soviet leaders have found out to their sorrow when it was their turn to be purged. . . .

The last time I was officially invited to return was to participate in the formal withdrawal of the Internationals from the Brigade. It was a weird farewell. The ceremonial speeches, the exchange of formal assurances and regrets between the departing Internationals and the remaining Spaniards could not mask the deep emotional chasm—the Internationals were jubilant, they were going home to the safety and enjoyment of civilian life; the Spaniards were despondent, they were left to face death by themselves.

After the official ceremony was over I found myself surrounded by a sea of Spanish comrades. We exchanged handshakes and embraces, some of them wept openly. I like to believe that I am not easily moved yet my eyes watered and my voice was husky. Captain Díaz, the Nationalist, looked deep into my eyes.

"Deserting the sinking ship, eh, Voros?" He said it in a soft voice, so low that no one around could hear him.

"This is the Communist fulfillment, <em>¿Verdad?</em>"

I could not answer in words, merely put my arm around him. I felt lower than a ship's rat. Captain Díaz and I would often argue Communism in private but I had not been able to convert him.

Now I knew why!
