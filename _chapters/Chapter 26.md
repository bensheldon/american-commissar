A few nights later Kovess called. It was most urgent, he couldn't discuss it over the phone, he wanted me to see him the next day, Saturday afternoon, in the editorial offices of the <em>Uj Elore</em>.

The editorial offices were on the third floor of a shabby walk-up building at 16 Union Square. When I asked for Kovess he came out to greet me and invited me for a cup of coffee in the co-operative cafeteria downstairs. I wasn't a coffee drinker but went along with him. Instead of taking one cup, Kovess placed two cups of coffee on his tray, both for himself, led me to an empty table, put sugar in both cups and, stirring both simultaneously, he plunged right into the subject.

The <em>Uj Elore</em> was in an editorial crisis. It was already down to a staff of five, one of whom was a secret Lovestoneite and had to be kicked out, which left only four. To add to the crisis the Central Committee had decided to move Kovess out of the Hungarian field and promote him to Secretary of all the Language Bureaus in the United States, which left the <em>Uj Elore</em> with a staff of only three who could not cope with the task of bringing out a national daily paper.

For a permanent solution they had appealed to Béla Kun in the Comintern to send them a man from among the revolutionary Hungarian writers living in exile in Moscow. Béla Kun came through, he wrote that a man had been picked and steps were being taken to smuggle him into the United States, but that was expected to take two months. The Hungarian Bureau had decided that I was to fill in for those two months, until the arrival of that comrade from Moscow.

I was flabbergasted. What did I know about Communism? How could I possibly interpret Communist Party policies?

Kovess readily ceded those points. In quality, a Communist paper definitely ranked far above an ordinary capitalist newspaper not only because of its superior Marxist-Leninist editorial approach but also because of the quality of the people on its staff who were carefully chosen from the ranks of the most able leaders of the revolutionary working class. I clearly did not qualify but—this was an emergency. Was I ready to start on Monday?

I wasn't ready to start at any time. For one thing, I had little respect for the <em>Uj Elore</em>; it was very poorly written and edited. Secondly, I liked my job and was loyal to my boss. I told Kovess I wasn't interested.

"It is the decision of the Party that you go on the staff of the<em>Uj Elore</em>!" Kovess informed me. "A Party decision is binding on all Communists!" he added incisively.

It was now a question of was I really a Communist. I wasn't sure. I felt my arm. It was still sore, but not too bad. I still said automatically, "The sonofabitches," but without any heat.

"What if I won't accept that decision?" I challenged.

"Then you could no longer belong to the Communist Party!"

"So what! I could still be a Communist from the outside."

Kovess' face turned harsh, there was fury in his voice.

"No, comrade. Once you quit the party you're automatically on the other side. Remember that soldier in John Reed's <em>Ten Days That Shook the World</em> who kept repeating: 'Those who are not with us are against us'? He was a simple, illiterate muzhik, but even he understood that historical truth. Your attitude reflects the historical weakness of the petty-bourgeois intellectual, the typical vacillation of the liberal fence-sitter who in a crisis usually sides with his own petty-bourgeois class and personal interests."

It was an effective speech. My respect for Kovess went up another notch. Here was a person who would view every problem with historical objectivity. I did not know then that this was "standard operational procedure" to be used against all who wavered in their loyalty to the Communist Party, and that I too, as a party functionary, would be using it in the same way countless times in the years to come.

I told Kovess that I wasn't at all enchanted by what I had seen of the party in action. Their discussions were vapid, their work was ineffective, their discipline was poor. In fact, I considered belonging to the party a waste of my time and was seriously considering quitting it anyway.

Kovess' entire attitude changed and his voice took on a conciliatory tone. Yes, most of what I said was unquestionably true. But didn't I see that was precisely the reason the party was being bolshevized, why the party desperately needed new blood, new leadership material like me. At the <em>Uj Elore</em> I would be working with mature, experienced Hungarian revolutionary leaders, unlike those sectarian rank-and-file American comrades in the unit—a rare opportunity for my political development.

"You'll find those two months the most rewarding experience in your life," Kovess tempted me.

Well, it was for two months only, and the prospect of my political development did sound rather attractive.

"Will you start on Monday?" Kovess pressed.

"I couldn't possibly walk out on my boss just like that, I'd have to give him at least two weeks notice to find someone in my place."

"Nonsense," said Kovess. "You're a Communist, you must rise above such petty-bourgeois conceptions. Loyalty to a boss is the loyalty of the slave to the whip."

Here was that dazzling insight again. How unerringly these people cut straight to the core of every social relationship. To develop that faculty, one really had to be part of the class struggle. My boss was all right, a good man as far as bosses went, but still a chiseling exploiter. He had only paid me for a one-week vacation that summer although he had promised two.

"You'll get paid twenty-five dollars a week," said Kovess. I was then getting a hundred. Twenty-five dollars a week would barely cover my rent and phone bill. That seventy-five dollars a week difference plus my Christmas bonus of five hundred coming to me for all the overtime I had put in and which I would now be forfeiting, would come to about a thousand dollars—a tremendous dent in my savings. But why on earth should I be thinking about money—that was only incidental. The only pertinent question boiled down to this: "Was I or was I not a real Communist?" At that moment I was and was not. Working for the <em>Uj Elore</em> would provide the definite answer.

"It's only for two months, comrade," coaxed Kovess, sensing my indecision. "A chance to turn into a real bolshevik."

I decided to give it a try for another two months.
