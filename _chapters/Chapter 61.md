title: Chapter 61

Once my eyes recovered their sight I was galvanized into action. This was the spring of 1939 and there was no time to waste. The Nazi war machine was getting ready to roll. People all over the world were pinning their hopes on the great Soviet Union with its mighty Red Army to forestall the Hitler juggernaut—that illusion needed to be blasted. I sat down and wrote day and night until I finished the draft of a short book which was aimed to shake the American people into awareness that the Soviet Union was just as totalitarian and equally as imperialistic as Nazi Germany.

That draft was titled "Chronicle of the Second World War," as set down by a young reporter with the last surviving American troops hiding out in a mountain post, awaiting the last assault. It was a projection of the coming World War II as I visualized it then, with Stalin villainously making war inevitable between Fascism and the democracies, and when they were both sufficiently exhausted falling first on Hitler, next on the democracies, ultimately taking possession of a devastated world.

When I was finished with it I thought of just the right organization for it—the World Peaceways, a group of pacifists who were not involved with any of the peace fronts of the Communists.

When Mr. Wise, Secretary of the World Peaceways, read that first draft he became enthused. He was thinking of an initial printing of 100,000 copies to be followed by a second printing of 200,000 and as many more as public interest in it warranted. He wanted changes though; his suggestions were good and I agreed to them instantly.

After that first draft was finished I rejoined the furriers union. Fur shops were still sweatshops and I would get home too fatigued physically to do much writing at night; by the time the manuscript was ready for editing it was late August. Two days later came the news of the Nazi-Soviet pact and my appointment with the World Peaceways set for the following week was canceled by silent agreement. No one needed my book any longer to warn him of Stalin's treachery, Hitler had already invaded Poland.

I followed with sardonic glee the gyrations of the party, the desperate flip-flops of the comrades to justify that Soviet-Nazi alliance. Yet even I couldn't foresee their ultimate degradation—that the remaining members of the Communist Party would openly work for the victory of Hitler. Thorez, the leader of the French Party, deserted the army and the French Communist Party issued leaflets calling on all other French soldiers not to fight Hitler but desert. Harry Pollit, the Secretary of the British Party, with whom I once spent a whole night in Madrid, called for making peace with Hitler even while Britain was being devastated by falling Nazi bombs. The Communist Party of America ordered my one-time Cleveland comrade Wyndham Mortimer to call a strike against the North American Aviation Corporation to keep our own country from producing planes in our defense. My former favorite Y.C.L. friend, Al Balint in Cleveland, led a steel strike to cripple our preparedness while my former colleague, devout Louis Budenz, the Catholic managing editor of the <em>Daily Worker</em>, was openly supplicating for the defeat of the democracies.

In 1940, I incurred the hostility of my Communist union by joining the Volunteers for Roosevelt for a third term, and on December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, I kissed my wife and infant son good-bye and went downtown to enlist.

The line was long, it stretched around the block. More and more people came to join it; there was shoving and jostling; it was difficult to keep the slowly moving line in order. A couple of young fellows thought I was an easy mark and tried to elbow me out of my place. Naturally I fought back and the Marine sergeant came up to investigate. "What's the trouble, Pop? What are you doing here?"

"I came to enlist, what else?"

I was indignant. Here I was, leaving my wife with my six-month-old son to fend for themselves because principles take precedence over family obligations; now some young squirt, who as likely as not had no real conception what this war was about, was trying to push me out of line.

"Come on, Pop, quit it," said the Marine sergeant with a friendly grin. He was tall, broad-shouldered—a trained, healthy specimen. "Be a nice guy, Pop, and give a chance to the young fellows. You don't belong here, Pop. When we need grandfathers, we'll call you," he coaxed.

The line rocked with laughter. The sergeant was not being sarcastic, he was humoring me, to the delight of those young men.

I left the line and walked away.

"Pop," they called me, and "Grandfather!"

I stopped in front of a plate glass window and took a good look at my reflection. My face was haggard and deeply etched; my cheeks sunken over the missing teeth I had lost in Spain and had no money to replace; I was still more than twenty pounds underweight because of a souvenir from Spain—chronic diarrhea. I was only forty-one, but Pop indeed; my soldiering days were over. The best a man of my age could expect in modern warfare would be guarding bridges. I went back to work utterly deflated.

Less than a month after that incident, on a sunny Sunday morning, I encountered Peter Chaunt, the Party boss of the I.W.O. Hungarian Section. I was wheeling my infant, he was walking his sleek wolfhound. We stopped to talk. When he asked how I felt about the war I told him about my frustration, about being too old to join in the fighting. Chaunt became most serious and told me I was in a position to make a very great contribution to fighting Fascism. The <em>Uj Elore</em> was no longer a Communist newspaper, it had changed its name and had been turned into a united front organ to rally all Hungarians in America regardless of creed or political beliefs behind the war effort. The Hungarian Horthy troops fighting alongside the Nazis were then deep in the Soviet Union, yet many Hungarians in the United States were still secretly sympathetic to Horthy. These men were traitors to their adopted country, the United States, yet were able to influence the ignorant Hungarian masses. Chaunt proposed that I come back and take over editorship of that paper; my name was popular with Hungarians; my past record as a fighting anti-Fascist would make me the ideal champion to rally the patriotic Hungarian masses around me.

That offer appealed to me. In the mobilization of our national resources for war I considered certain steps dangerous for the welfare of our nation, like the order that froze wages while leaving profits uncurbed. I expressed those thoughts to Chaunt, adding the Leninist slogan: "We mustn't allow the capitalists to profiteer and place the burden of the war on the shoulders of the working class."

"You've really been away too long, you've really lost touch," Chaunt replied condescendingly.

Nothing mattered in this war but one thing, to save the Soviet Union, Chaunt explained the new party line. Let the capitalists make all the profits they can, let them raise prices, do anything they pleased as long as they turned out the war materials the Soviet Union needed. As Marx said, "The greater the profits, the greater the capitalist incentive." We had to spur on this capitalist incentive by preventing strikes; by using all our influence to drive the workers to greater productivity, to make them work double shifts and to hell with time and a half for overtime. The interests of the Soviet Union were the supreme guide; if that interest was best served by helping American capitalists to greater profits, then dialectically that was what we had to do, that was Leninism.

I was too amazed to speak. Chaunt took my silence for agreement. "Come see me tomorrow morning and don't forget to bring your statement with you."

"What statement?"

"A statement confessing your errors, admitting that the party line is always right. Stress particularly how right the party was in making that nominal pact with Hitler; explain how you became a victim of the warmongers by not realizing that that pact was the greatest contribution by the Soviet Union to maintaining peace, which only failed because of the Chamberlain and Blum imperialist warmongers."

Chaunt was petting his dog. It was a sleek, aristocratic wolf-hound—Russian, not Soviet. Chaunt himself looked more prosperous than I had ever seen him.

"Is it a real united front paper?"

"Sure. That's why you're needed so badly, that's why I want you to start tomorrow."

"I am ready to start tomorrow. But I want to publish my statement as a two-column signed editorial on the front page."

"Why on the front page?"

"Because I want it there. And I want it published as written."

Chaunt was now wary. "Of course the Central Committee will have to go over it and pass on it before publication. They may want some changes made."

"Not if it is a united front paper."

I still played it straight, noting with delight the beginning of a doubt in Chaunt's eyes. Now it was my turn to assume the long- familiar Communist tone of lecturing, to count off the points one by one on my thumb.

Number one: My statement would open with the announcement that I was no longer a party member, that I was assuming editorship of the paper only because of my firm belief in the need of united effort to bring this war for the survival of democracy to a successful conclusion.

Number two: Next I would explain that I had quit the party because I was opposed to the tyrannical and despotic practices in the Soviet Union which permeated all Communist Parties in the world.

Number three: I have reached the conclusion that ever since Stalin came into power the Communist Party Line has been wrong in all its major decisions beginning with the policy in China in 1927 up to and including the criminal adventure of the
Nazi-Soviet pact which exploded the Second World War.

Chaunt did not hear me all out. He yanked the dog viciously to his feet and stalked away, his freckled face livid with anger.

There may have been no connection but shortly afterward I began to experience trouble in the fur market.

I would go on a new job in the morning; there would be a whispered conversation between the shop chairman and some workers who recognized me; the boss would call me in later and I would be dismissed without explanation or, where the boss needed me badly, with a despondent shrug—"I like your work but I can't afford to have trouble with the union." One day I became embroiled in a physical fight. I was called a paid Nazi spy, sharp furriers' knives flashed. Had it not been for the timely appearance of two policemen I might have been carved up or crippled, a fit punishment for an anti-Communist.

That made it obvious both to my wife and me that sooner or later I would be forced out of a job in every fur shop, that we had to leave New York.

We counted our resources—a few hundred dollars in cash savings, some used furniture—a pitifully small stake to start a new existence. Never mind. We settled on a small town, half rural, half urban, which was most unlikely to harbor any Communists who knew me.

We moved there convinced that the trail had come to an end; that my life as a Communist would be but a memory of my past, that nothing would hinder me from adjusting myself to the normal life of a citizen.

It did work out except for the stigma.
