THE ALBACETE GENERALS
On the front of Albacete
Meet the generals of the rear.
Oh! They fight the grandest battles
Though the shells they never hear,
For the wind is in their make-up.
You can hear the generals say:
"Yes, we're going to Jarama
<em>Mañana</em> or next day."
. . . See them strolling in the evening
To the grogshops for their wine,
For they are the brave defenders
Of the Albacete line.

—<em>Anonymous British I.B. Volunteer</em>

Reporting from the isolation of Almansa to the buzzing beehive of Albacete, the base of the International Brigades, was like the awakening of Rip van Winkle—it took time to adjust.

Albacete, peacetime population 40,000, capital of the province of the same name in southeastern Spain, had been swollen by war refugees and the Internationals to more than three times its normal size. The Internationals dominated the town. The best public buildings and private residences had been taken over by I.B. Headquarters for their offices—its hotels, restaurants, cafés, two movies, streets and thoroughfares, whorehouses, vinoshops were thronged by volunteers from all corners of the world.

I reported to Comrade Fiala, Chief of the Historical Commission—a tall, broad-shouldered, close-mouthed Pole.

A few minutes' discussion carried on in halting German which we both spoke with an equally heavy accent, his Polish, mine Hungarian, soon made it clear to me that Fiala had only a vague conception of how to get the Historical Commission started. Nor did he indicate any marked inclination to stick his political neck out by taking the initiative.

All he had done was to ask the Base Command to send out a letter to all commands in the International Brigades asking them to forward to our commission all documents, including the plans and orders pertaining to their past battles. Fiala's idea was that once those documents came in, and we had to allow time for that, we'd go over them and analyze them. He was rather hazy about what we were to look for in those documents and on what basis we were to evaluate them.

Fiala was a highly intelligent person, a member of the Polish Bureau of the Comintern, in civilian life a Communist professor of history. He was a bureaucrat of the Soviet mold, insulated by layers of suspicion and mistrust he had acquired in the illegal Polish underground Communist movement and more particularly during the years he had lived under the shadow of the purges in Moscow. It took quite an effort to get through to him. I was the first American he had encountered with whom he had a chance to speak at length and he asked me many questions about the way the Party operated in America. My candid replies both fascinated and shocked him; they evidently strengthened his conviction that we were just amateurs blithely unconcerned about the most elementary rules of conspiratorial technique, a bunch of overgrown kids playing at revolution and bragging about it.

I showed him my memos on my interviews with the few early Lincoln members who had been transferred to Almansa, also the few diaries I had collected from them. That bit of news interested him greatly, now at least we had some "documents" to put into the files of the Historical Commission. Then I startled him with the proposal that instead of waiting for those "documents" to be forwarded to us I be authorized to go after them to the Brigades in the field, and asked him to get me a <em>Salvo Conducto</em> (literally "Safe Conduct," a military pass) for the front.

I spent the time waiting for that pass circulating around Albacete, striking up conversations and becoming friendly with volunteers of all ranks and nationalities. It was amazing how eager they were to open up after I convinced them their confidences would be respected. I was shocked by my findings. Instead of international solidarity, dog eat dog seemed to be the rule governing the relationships of the various Communist Parties with one another; their leaderships were in cutthroat rivalry for the favor of Moscow.

Moreover, a great schism existed between the "Albacete generals," the recipients of political and military plums, the members of the I.B. command, and the rank and file volunteers, particularly those among the rank and file who were officially
pronounced "bad elements."

These "bad elements" were the crippled, the amputees, the men with half-healed wounds, the ill, the shell-shocked, the broken in spirit-the wrecks of those early volunteers who had stopped Franco at the gates of Madrid with little other equipment than small arms and their willingness to offer up their ill-fed bodies for sacrifice.They were of all nationalities, French, Belgian, German, Irish, Scottish, Jewish, British, Slovak, Yugoslav, Czech, Polish, Hungarian, including quite a few Americans. They were swarming all over Albacete tramping from office to office in search of prosthesis, repatriation, postoperative care, back pay, clothing, food, sleeping accommodations, political advice, or merely a friendly word.

The "bad elements" were the rank and file survivors of those early desperately fought battles that had filled with glory the party press of every country. They were the first volunteers on the scene whose sacrifices formed the base for all the Communist financial appeals, whose heroism raised the prestige of the Communist Parties with the intellectuals, liberals, and anti-Fascists. However, the names publicized by the Communist Parties were seldom those of the rank and file who had suffered the most, but of those comrades whom the party wanted to build up. They became the "heroes" while these unfortunates, the debris of those battles, became the "bad elements."

These "bad elements" overflowed the streets, sitting on the curbs and park benches in their tattered uniforms, or simply leaning against the wall outside the offices, feeding each other's discontent by loud descriptions of their hardships, of the cowardice of many of their superior officers and commissars. These were the multitudes found in every society since the dawn of history who were born to the dry teat and predestined for the bottom of the heap; whose misery gave birth to Moses, to Christ, to Marx, to the Utopians.

It was easy to see why these "bad elements" felt themselves betrayed by the party. They had been made to believe that they were volunteering to join a "People's Army" where all would share the vicissitudes of war equally. Then came the shock of reality; they found themselves under a military rule paralleling that of the Soviet Union where caste differentiation and the privileges enjoyed by officers and commissars were incomparably greater than those existing in the armies of the capitalist countries.

The Americans, having been brought up in the easy democratic way of America, particularly resented this unexpected class differentiation between the comrades who were made officers and commissars and the comrades who remained in the ranks. A number of American volunteers who were loudest in their complaints against the party leadership were ultimately made to pay for it with their lives in the jails of SIM.

At that time I merely noted those stories, suspending judgment until they could be authenticated by filling in that six-month gap in the history of the American volunteers that elapsed between their arrival and mine. That was difficult, for no official records were kept of that early period. Luck finally led me to George Brodsky who had been denounced to me by most of those early arrivals as the worst example of the behavior of Party leaders and commissars in Spain.

When I located him George Brodsky was being kept in seclusion by the party awaiting repatriation. I found him a broken old man although barely in his thirties. He wouldn't talk to me at first, he had been pledged to secrecy. When I finally induced him to confide in me, he not only talked, he spilled over.

His account was not quite coherent—he was still unnerved by his experiences, his eyes would dissolve in tears from time to time as he pleaded for my understanding.

The first group of volunteers, 96 in number, left New York on December 25, 1936, followed within days by other, more numerous groups. Except for five or six men with previous military training in the peace-time regular army or the National Guard, none of those volunteers had a real conception of army life nor had they been prepared for what they might encounter in Spain. Worse still, the party had sent them overseas without assigning to them even a single leading party member with sufficient organizational experience who would have commanded their respect. In short, they were leaderless, which gave rise to immediate factional groupings. Thus the unity of the group was destroyed from the start. Officially, Brodsky had been placed in charge of the group in New York but he lacked the necessary qualities of leadership and experience to enforce his authority.

They arrived in Spain on January 6, 1937, and were taken to the old Spanish fort Figueras near the French border, the assembly center for the Internationals. The camp was run by the French who proceeded to give the Americans their first taste of international solidarity in practice. The French comrades received the Americans with hostility, unwilling to share their rations with them, and bivouacked them in the worst barrack rooms, the floors of which were littered with human excrement. Many of the volunteers wanted to turn back immediately, others openly talked of desertion.

Brodsky had found himself right in the middle; the Americans were blaming him for their treatment by the French, while the French command held him responsible for the rebellious behavior of the Americans. As ranking party member Brodsky next was appointed Albacete Base Commissar for all Americans who were now arriving daily in Spain. The French command in Albacete showed themselves equally discriminatory against Americans, keeping them on short rations, which demoralized the Americans even more.

Brodsky again was in the middle. The Americans raised demands and insisted on conditions which they expected Brodsky to enforce with the I.B. Command, with whom he carried no weight. The I.B. Command in turn, disgusted and contemptuous of those "spoiled cry-babies," those "arrogant Americans," held Brodsky responsible for their conduct. Considering them of little worth, they decided to disperse the Americans, to use them as replacements for other units, the British and Irish particularly; thus denying them the opportunity to serve in units of their own under their own command. (It was the story of General Pershing versus Field Marshal Foch all over again, but Brodsky was no Pershing nor did he have Old Black Jack's political backing.)

Had Brodsky been an experienced party leader, had he been entrusted with authority to represent the Central Committee of the United States, had he been given a "silk ribbon," he could have taken a tougher stand, because ultimately all those matters were decided by the party. As it was, the existing situation was permitted to worsen and a number of Americans had actually been detached and sent to other units.

The story culminated in the Americans being sent to the Jarama front without training, under a makeshift and inexperienced command, which resulted in the death of a disproportionately high number of them right at the outset of the battle. The surviving volunteers again blamed Brodsky for that and cried for his head.

Brodsky was eventually removed and a few days after our talk whisked back by the party to the United States in ignominious secrecy. He was still absolutely loyal to the party when we had our talk—he was not sufficiently astute politically to comprehend that the enormous weight of guilt for the needless death of those comrades which had brought about his breakdown was not his but rested with the Central Committee of the American party for entrusting the fate of hundreds into
such inexperienced hands.

Incidentally, other early American contingents had similarly sorry experiences with their political leaders, as will be seen subsequently in Major Merriman's account. This explains why the political leaders of the I.B., the "Albacete Generals" from André Marty down, were held in such contempt by the average volunteer.

All hosannas in the <em>Daily Worker</em> and other party publications to the contrary notwithstanding—most volunteers hated the guts of those party leaders.
