I spent three days visiting with the men in Tarazona, seeking out those early volunteers who might help me to piece together a record of the Americans from their first arrival in Spain. Captain Merriman, then Commander of the Mac-Pap Battalion, was one of those first arrivals, in fact he had been the Commander of the Lincoln Battalion when it was first thrown into action at Jarama.

Captain Merriman was one of those rare men who radiate strength and inspire confidence by their very appearance. He was tall and broad-shouldered with a ruddy bronze complexion overlaying his originally pink skin; thin flax-colored hair framed his bald pink scalp. The physical strength of the athlete combined with the reserved manners of the scholar and the introspective expression in his eyes bespoke great inner power.

Robert Hale Merriman was born in 1908 near the West Coast of Scotch-English parents. His father was a lumberjack, his mother a writer—a combination that left its marks on his subsequent career.

Because of poverty he left home at an early age and worked his way through high school—as a janitor in a bank, as a part time grocery clerk, and occasionally a window trimmer. After finishing high school he considered he had enough of an education and began traveling around the country, working now in a logging camp felling trees, sometimes as a millwright and pulp feeder, and once, for a stretch, as Number Three Man in a paper mill.

In one of those logging camps he met an extraordinary Irishman who was to exert a great influence on his future life. That Irishman would work hard for six months, then quit, spending the other six months of the year in public libraries, studying whatever happened to engage his interest. This way of life attracted Merriman. If studying was that much fun he too would take it up again, and as long as he was to do that, he might as well go to college.

Merriman had very little money saved but he knew that a young man six feet two weighing 190 pounds who had played football in high school ought not to find it difficult to get a scholarship. He applied to the University of Nevada and was immediately accepted; he played end on the varsity football team and even joined a fraternity until he suddenly found himself in the middle of a Nevada winter with gaping holes in his soles and an empty pocket trying to major in economics.

The leaking shoes presented no real problem—he stuck cardboard inside them. But money presented a twin problem, how to make it and how to save it. He tackled the second one first. As an economy move he resigned from Sigma Mu, which caused a great scandal on campus. That was the first time anyone had voluntarily resigned his valued membership in that great fraternity.

As an immediate solution to the problem of making money he joined the R.O.T.C. which paid $7.50 a month, an income which he eked out by trying his hand again at window decorating. The highest point of financial affluence he ever reached in that period came when he succeeded in obtaining a job in a marathon dance contest as a janitor to keep the floor waxed between the feet of the dancing couples and to sweep away the chewing gum wrappers, orange peels, and other waste products of that great contribution to the culture of the thirties. His summer vacations were spent working alternately as a cement mixer at a naval ammunition depot and as a ditch digger for a water company and, when nothing better was to he found, as a hay hand on a ranch.

Upon graduation he became Assistant Instructor of Economics at the University of California where in his second year he advanced to Head Assistant Instructor. At about this time, when examining the contrast between the theories of classical economics he was teaching and the actual facts of life around him in the depression, he was led to conclude that Marx was right about capitalism. That conclusion in turn led to the deduction that to be true to his conscience it behooved him to do something about the existing state of affairs.

The least he thought he could do was help to improve the sorry lot of the migratory workers who were then cruelly exploited by the great growers of California. He was not ready to go all the way and join the Communist Party because he considered the routine of the party much too confining. Instead he joined one of the convenient auxiliary organizations set up by the party for precisely that purpose, the International Labor Defense. Soon he became most active in the I.L.D. East Bay Committee. He organized I.L.D. branches at the University and took an active part in the defense of the Imperial Valley strikers in 1933 whose demands for a living wage and more tolerable sanitary conditions were met by court injunctions and brutal physical assaults, arrests, and vicious jail sentences. His activities in the I.L.D. also involved him in other bitter strikes in that area in which the shedding of blood and crippling beatings by vigilantes and professional strikebreakers were everyday occurrence.

The next phase in Merriman's life started with his winning the Newton Booth Traveling Fellowship in Economics for a field trip in Europe. Money again became a pressing problem, for he needed more funds for the study he wanted to undertake than the Fellowship provided. In addition, he was saddled with the responsibility of partially supporting the family of his girlfriend, later his wife, Marion. (She herself would merit a separate study—a brave, wholesome American girl—because of her admirable behavior in Spain where she joined her husband in Tarazona.)

Robert Hale Merriman, holder of the Newton Booth Fellowship, Head Instructor of Economics at the great University of California, knew of only one way to make more money than his academic salary which barely provided a minimum subsistence—manual labor. In consequence he quit teaching at the University and went to work as a body-polisher in the Ford assembly plant in Richmond. The speed-up and unhealthy working conditions in that plant proved too much even for his sturdy frame. When a few brave souls in the plant whispered about organization, Merriman joined with them and helped to get out an illegal shop paper, the first one to make its surreptitious appearance in that plant. Merriman wrote the editorial for it, his first, "What's the Meaning of Industrial Democracy?"

He quit his job with Ford to go to work on an economic research project for F.E.R.A. on "Current Changes Survey: Seasonal Variations." Later he became supervisor of a medical survey in San Francisco; still later, State Supervisor of "Current Changes Study" in California. He made use of his position to hire as many radicals as the payroll would hold who, because of their views, had difficulty in getting placements. During the San Francisco general strike in 1934 he took charge of publicity, rather counterpublicity, to keep football players from signing up with Coach "Navy Bill" Ingram who was then recruiting a special contingent of football players for strikebreaking.

By 1935, Merriman had saved up enough to make use of his scholarship for European travel. He went to the Soviet Union to study on the spot the application of Marxian economics. He studied at the Institute of Economics in Moscow and afterward spent eight months living on various collective farms, making notes of their operation and compiling statistics. His experiences with collective farming in the U.S.S.R. made him curious to know what farming was like in Eastern Europe. He went on an extended trip to Greece, the Balkans, Hungary, and then returned to Moscow to write a book about his findings. He was in the midst of his book when the Spanish Civil War broke out. At first the Soviet Union kept hands off. But when it decided to help the Loyalists strong pressure was brought on all non-Russians in Moscow to join the International Brigades in Spain. Merriman was made to feel ashamed that not a single American was at that time fighting in the International Brigades; he was reproached at every turn for being engaged in the frivolous pastime of writing a book while Fascism was nakedly endeavoring to strangle all humanity. So Merriman left Moscow and landed in Spain on January 11, 1937.

The account that follows is my memo of that interview, typed out hastily for the raw files of the Historical Commission, incorporating data he permitted me to copy from his diary:

ADD HISTORY LINCOLN

INTERVIEW WITH CAPT. ROBERT HALE MERRIMAN,
FIRST COMMANDER LINCOLN BATT'N.
July 11-12, 1937

Merriman arrived in Spain from the Soviet Union where he was studying economics and agriculture on a scholarship, on January 11, 1937.

He came here without any knowledge about the existence of other American volunteers. He contacted representatives of International Brigades in Valencia. They sent him to Villa Nueva de la Jara to join the Americans who had landed a few days before—about a hundred men.

Arriving at Villa Nueva he found the Americans in turmoil. It seemed the command wanted to put the Americans in with the Irish, and the Americans refused. There was strong friction between the two groups—the Americans allegedly sober, earnest, enthusiastic, and idealistic, the Irish drunken and fighting.

The Americans lacked both political and military leadership. The first volunteers were almost religiously anti-Fascist, the overwhelming majority of them party members.

When he arrived, Merriman found a grievance committee already established consisting of Royce, Morris, and Bernie Walsh. [Walsh later transferred to the artillery in Almansa—S.V.] Stern acted as political commissar. James Harris was their military leader (at present with Dombrowsky battalion). The day Merriman arrived Hagilow, Acting Sergeant, had arrested and brought in as a prisoner, Comrade Ferrari who was second in command, charging him with being a Fascist.

Met Stamber for the first time who was supposed to be their political leader; Stamber complained he was slighted by the comrades under him because he was not a member of the Central Committee.

There wasn't even a semblance of military organization. The military commander arrested the political commissar. The politi-cal commissar in turn arrested the military commander. The grievance committee of three took on the function of both military and political commands as well as that of a tribunal. Party fraction meetings were held with arbitrary invitations. Those party members not invited went into a funk, protested decisions; wouldn't accept decisions.

Stamber and Merriman were called to Albacete to see Marty. Marty was very angry with the Americans, called them spoiled children, and threatened to send them back home unless they snapped out of it. He gave them a party leaflet dealing, strangely, with the agrarian question, and told them to study it carefully because that represented the official position of the party on the Spanish question. Col. Vidal, commander of the Albacete I.B. base, was also present at the conference.

Following the conference Vidal, Stamber, and Merriman went out to Villa Nueva and held a meeting with the men. Col. Vidal told them the Loyalist Army was not a Communist Army and explained the function of the military commander and the political commissar.

The men were greatly surprised at the news. They had thought they were to function the way a party unit does at home, under the leadership of their own party fraction. The comrades were mostly party members approximately on the same level of development, many middle party functionaries among them, none of them recognized as an outstanding leader. Every meeting ended in a fight because each comrade considered his own individual interpretation of the situation to be the right party line and that of the others wrong. The situation was made even more acute by the practice of holding secret caucuses: those not invited felt slighted and organized fractions of their own.

Following the meeting with Vidal, organization began to emerge. Stamber was made political commissar, Harris military commander, and Merriman staff officer.

Harris claimed wide military experience gained with the U.S. Army in China. A former seaman—supposedly a good field leader—he lacked experience in giving lectures. His favorite method was to pose a problem and suddenly ask somebody, without previous explanation: "What would you do in that case?" No matter what the answer was he would invariably reply in front of all the others, "You'd kill off all your men that way."

This answer had the effect of discouraging all who were selected for company and section commanders. They would resign time and time again—especially since the men they were supposed to lead had also heard that answer and therefore wouldn't place much confidence in their leadership. This constant changing and shifting of officers largely accounted for the fact that when the battalion had moved up to the front there were no officers and noncoms to step into the breach and take command when the need for it arose.

Merriman as staff officer received instructions from Col. Vidal to build up Harris. In order to do so Harris had to be isolated from the men so they couldn't observe him closely. He was stopped from lecturing. All orders were drawn up by Merriman for Harris to sign because Harris was incompetent to draft a clean-cut order. The building up of Harris succeeded to an even greater degree than anticipated and had rather disastrous effects later on.

The men at Villa Nueva were entirely isolated from the base in Albacete. They had no trucks, received no supplies—they had to buy their food and supplies with their own money. The men became almost rebellious. They received no news even about the fighting in Spain, didn't know what was going on in the world.

Suspicion attached itself to Harris about money matters also. Harris spent money freely claiming it was his own, that he had received it from the Central Commitee of the party in New York, while there were grounds to believe he had received the money from the base for the men. [This angle of it has not yet been investigated-S.V.]

In the meantime more and more men kept on arriving. The training was at first conducted along American military lines. Later it was suggested to use a combination of French and American formations.

The plan was to train one company, send it to the front, and later build a battalion around it as more men arrived and received training.

At about this time Steve Daduk joined the outfit. Daduk had been in Spain for months, had fought on three or four fronts, and been wounded a few times.

Daduk was appointed Commander of Company I, with John Scott second in command.

The relationship with the population became very good. They had much opposition and distrust to overcome. The French before them had not behaved in a manner that was expected of them. They went on drunken sprees, brawled, they even insulted women and kept their quarters very dirty. Things had come to such a pass that when the Americans first arrived in town the populace didn't even want to show them where the barracks were located.

The Americans went about things in a systematic manner to improve this relation. They donated 6,000 pesetas to the local <em>Socorro Rojo</em>. They showed films for the children in the morning, for the townspeople in the afternoon and for the soldiers in the evening. The battalion doctor held daily clinics treating the townspeople without fee, and the population worshiped him. They organized a <em>fiesta</em> for the Red Cross and raffled off an American pie that brought in 200 pesetas. Before long they succeeded in winning the affection of the townspeople to such a degree that they were offered the finest buildings in town for their use. The Cuban comrades played a very important role in improving the situation.

Commissar Stamber did a good job in winning over the townspeople. But this didn't hold true when it came to the battalion. He failed to develop political leaders in the battalion—the purpose for which he had been originally assigned. He was supposed to stay with the battalion only ten days but since he failed to develop leadership he had to stay on.

Around this time they decided to hold a military maneuver to demonstrate to Marty and other generals the degree of training they had reached. Just before the maneuver a row developed between the commanders of Company I and II, they both threatened to arrest each other.

Despite the personal friction and other obstacles the maneuver was a success. Marty and the generals were pleased and as a reward they awarded the Americans the honor to be the first unit to occupy the model camp of the International Brigades which was to be completed in Pozo Rubio around February 10 or 12.

By this time Harris had been well built up. The men who saw little of him thought him a good military commander. Col. Vidal had the idea that Harris had been picked directly by the C.C. of C.P.U.S.A. to command the Americans.

The battalion had grown to 400 men by this time. Merriman suddenly took ill. Harris rushed to his sickbed, all excited, and told him an incoherent tale of how he had overheard a fantastic plot against himself. Allegedly Royce, Morris, and other leading comrades had held a secret meeting at which they were plotting to remove Harris from command.

On February 12 the battalion received orders to move to Pozo Rubio. The same day the British division was moved to the front.

Later in the same day an order came from Vidal in Albacete requesting "Captain Harris and Captain Merriman" to report to Albacete. Since at this time neither Harris nor Merriman held any rank and the usual custom was to appoint the commanders only when they were about to go to the front, Merriman and Harris immediately guessed the situation, especially since the order stated that the battalion was to move to Albacete instead of Pozo Rubio.

Merriman and Harris went to Albacete, the battalion following them. In Albacete they were informed they were going to the front. At Vidal's office Merriman and Harris were given revolvers, field glasses.

The battalion was marched to the bull ring and there equipped. The equipment was issued haphazardly. Bayonets did not fit the rifles; many pieces of vital equipment were missing altogether.

According to instructions, Harris was to act as commander and Merriman as his adjutant. Harris became extremely unnerved and excited. He told Merriman he was equally responsible with him for leading the battalion.

Marty and Col. Vidal made an inspection of the battalion in the bull ring. Harris became more and more unnerved—he grabbed rifles out of the men's hands saying he was a rifle inspector. It was obvious something was wrong with him and the men began to murmur that Harris was drunk. Battalion Commissar Stamber in consequence ordered Harris to bed. Harris went away but came back after a while and fired his pistol off in the <em>Guardia Nacional</em>, then disappeared again.

When the convoy pulled out at midnight February 15 Harris was nowhere to be found. Informed about it, Col. Vidal placed Merriman officially in command of the battalion.

The convoy was very poorly organized, the trucks broke down quite often. When they arrived at Chinchon, their destination, they couldn't find Brigade H.Q. Merriman went on to Morata where he was told by General Gall to bring up his men immediately.

Following this order, Merriman ordered his men to take off their shirts and use them to wipe off the heavy grease on the new rifles just issued to them. Since most of the volunteers had never held a rifle in their hands before, he ordered each to fire five rounds into the bushes on the mountainside so as to have some idea about handling a rifle before going into battle.

Merriman, who had been advanced from adjutant to battalion commander, now needed an adjutant himself. He couldn't appoint one of the company commanders because that would have disturbed the leadership of the companies. Against his better judgment he had to appoint Daduk.

When they reached Morata they witnessed their first aerial fight. Our planes chased the Fascists off and brought down two planes. The men stood up well under the bombardment.

On February 17, they moved into the second line of reserve to a position on a hill later known as "Suicide Hill." It was a very steep hill encircled by a railroad on three sides, overlooking both our lines and those of the Fascists, offering a clear view of the Teguna Valley.

The nights were wet, soaking the blankets—the men were drugged by lack of sleep.

On February 18, the Fascist planes came over and bombed the battalion again. From then on they were subjected to heavy artillery shelling and at least one aerial bombardment daily. While in this position they witnessed the biggest air battle in Spain to that date, taking place directly above them with about 85 planes participating.

The Lincoln Battalion lost its first man here. Charles Edwards was killed while making observations from an outpost trench. Edwards kept shouting to the men around him: "You got to keep your head down! There is a sniper shooting at us here."
When he, too, in turn was warned to take cover, he retorted: "I am sent here to observe. F . . . you!" The next moment he was drilled through the head by a bullet.

The total strength of the battalion at that time was about 377 men. Their pay was three pesetas a day.

The men dug in on Suicide Hill, although very short of implements. They had only 35 picks and shovels in the entire battalion. Later they received 35 more.

As it turned out, the Americans played an important role by the mere fact of being positioned on Suicide Hill. The Lincoln Battalion acted as a reserve for the entire XV Division. At that time the situation was rather precarious. The improvised Spanish <em>milicia</em> units had simply quit the front and the battle-weary Thaelmann and Franco-Belge brigades were becoming discouraged because they had not seen any reserves. As a matter of fact, they no longer believed in the existence of reserves—they thought that was another empty promise.

Now suddenly they beheld an entire new battalion, fresh American troops at that, decked out on the mountainside in plain view of friend and foe alike serving as reserves and they took heart anew.

The presence and example of the Americans also had a good effect on the Spanish troops. The Spanish had an aversion to digging in and they said it couldn't be done there anyway because the ground was too rocky. Now they saw the Americans digging in on even rockier ground.

Whenever the Fascists would bomb the front line trenches the Spanish troops would usually break and run leaving the Fascists free to occupy their positions and would suffer far greater casualties while fleeing than if they had remained in their trenches.

The Spaniards now saw the Americans stay in their trenches despite air raids, bombings, and shelling and thereby avoiding casualties. This gave them more confidence in the protection offered by entrenchment.

The presence of the Americans on Suicide Hill had its effect on the Fascists, too. They saw they couldn't attempt to break through without running into fire from both flanks.

In the six days spent on Suicide Hill the American casualties were low—two men killed and a few wounded.

On February 21, the battalion moved into the old Dimitrov position. The order was given by Lieutenant Wattis, an Englishman on the Brigade Staff, who told them to move in without their packs and blankets. The packs and blankets accordingly were left behind, most of them never recovered. This caused additional hardship in that wintry weather, leaving the men shivering in the cold, night and day.

The battalion was very poorly equipped. It lacked telephones and other necessary equipment. The battalion officers were seldom called to meet with the brigade—most of the time they were ignorant of what the battalion was expected to do. This was one of the reasons why Lieutenant Wattis, who talked big and claimed he was doing all the planning on the XV Brigade Staff, was in a position to give orders.

On February 23, the Americans were ordered to move into the gap that existed between the lines held by the Dimitrov and the 24th Spanish battalions. According to the plan the Americans were then to go into attack, with the Dimitrov and the Spanish moving up simultaneously.

The Americans moved into the gap and according to orders went into an attack, getting fairly close to the Fascist trenches. Had the other two battalions moved up also, they could have broken through the Fascist lines at Jarama. Since they failed to do so the Americans had to withdraw, losing about sixty men—twenty dead and about forty wounded.

[Previous to the Feb. 23 attack Col. Klauss, Chief of Staff of the Brigade, called in Merriman to order the Lincoln battalion to assist the German Thaelmann battalion. Just then Harris reappeared on the scene from nowhere and, taking advantage of Merriman's absence, told the comrades he had been sent to reorganize the battalion and he was taking over command. He gave orders to the battalion to move into a new position. He took the second company out personally and they wandered around in great confusion under heavy machine-gun fire. As the night progressed Harris became delirious. He told the men he saw "50,000 Fascists ready to attack" and wanted to lead the battalion into action until Merriman learned of the situation and had him removed in an ambulance.

This incident happened around February 21 or 22 and is often referred to by the Lincoln boys as the "Moonlight Walk." Despite the heavy fire, that whole evening resulted in only one casualty.—Voros]

Daduk, Merriman's adjutant, also cracked and had to be sent to the hospital. Seacord, commander of the machine gun company, was then made adjutant.

On February 24, the Lincoln moved into the position formerly held by the Dimitrov. They were without food. The same day they received reinforcements—about 65 new American volunteers without any training whatsoever. These men had never handled rifles before, they had no helmets or other necessary equipment—most of them had arrived only a few days before in Albacete. They were rushed to the front with orders that they be given two days' training behind the lines. These reinforcements brought the total of the battalion up to its original strength, around 400 men.

The morale of Franco-Belge and English troops was very low by that time—they had to be taken out of the lines for a day's rest.

On February 26, a Fascist prisoner revealed that the Fascist forces opposing them were very weak. The XV Brigade in consequence decided on an attack.

The objective was to push the Fascists back behind the Jarama River. According to the plan, the 24th Spanish Battalion was to form the spearhead of the attack with the Lincoln to support their left flank in active defense position. After the Spanish reached the road the entire brigade was to move up. The attack was set for the 27th. The plan of operations was as follows:

<blockquote markdown=1>
9:50 A.M.: Artillery barrage lasting IO minutes.
10:00 A.M.: 24th Battalion to move up supported by tanks on the right flank.

Armored cars to be brought up behind the old Dimitrov posi- tion to annihilate the Fascist machine-gun nests. The cavalry to be brought in play to evacuate the wounded and exploit the gains of the attack. Twenty airplanes to participate in the attack, bombing and strafing the Fascist trenches.
</blockquote>

Lieutenant Colonel Copic, Brigade Commander, was very proud of the plan and issued instructions that it be explained in detail to every man so they could see all services co-ordinated for one attack.

The Americans had not been equipped with telephone or maps. Telephone and maps were now promised to them for the attack, also new machine guns because the ones they had were so old they could seldom keep more than three in working condition at the same time.

Daybreak found the battalion still without phone connection with the brigade. Maps arrived, but were not worth much. At 8:50 A.M. the Brigade telephone men reported they hadn't enough wire to make connections.

The artillery opened up as per schedule but their shells fell in front of the English reserve positions instead of the Spanish or Lincoln battalions where the attack was scheduled.

Lieutenant Colonel Klauss sent orders to the Lincoln not to leave the trenches till the Spanish battalion advanced at least 50 meters.

No airplanes were in sight. Two armored cars showed up in the rear but refused to participate in the attack.

The Spanish went over the top on schedule, advanced about 15 meters under very heavy fire, then withdrew to the trenches, refusing to advance further without artillery or tank support.

Klauss then gave orders for the Americans to attack to encourage the Spanish to advance again.

The first American company on the right flank went over the top. The second company was also ordered over by Klauss. In the middle of the attack the Brigade informed the battalion that the reason the planes did not come was that the battalion had failed to put out an airplane signal. The battalion had never heard of an airplane signal until then nor did it know what it was. Once that was explained, the men hurriedly made a <stron>T</strong> signal out of their shirts and put it out with the leg of the <strong>T</strong> pointing to the enemy. Comrade Streysand was killed while laying out this signal.

When the phone connection was finally established Brigade Commander Copic claimed that the Spanish had already advanced 700 meters and they were being killed off because the Lincoln battalion had failed to support them. When Merriman informed him about the true state of affairs Copic angrily interrupted him.

"Don't contradict me," he yelled, and added that the Americans had disgraced the Brigade, they had spoiled the advance by their failure to attack. Although informed of the high concentration of machine gun fire on the Lincoln he gave Merriman ten minutes to make up that 700 meter advance.

Following that conversation three planes arrived out of 20 promised. The planes flew over the Fascists and left after a single sortie.

Signaling with his arm to the men to go over the top, Merriman was hit in the left shoulder by a bullet that broke the bone in five places. Seacord, the battalion adjutant, having been killed, Merriman turned over command to Phil Cooperman, the Battalion Clerk, and though wounded, talked personally with the Franco-Belge and English to take over the trench before permitting himself to be carried off. He ordered his reluctant stretcher-bearers to take him to Brigade Headquarters to speak with Copic. When he arrived Copic stated Merriman was too weak to be allowed to speak and refused to hear him.

On February 27 a number of mistakes were made. Usually an attack is called off when certain key conditions don't materialize. The services did not participate in the attack in the co-ordinated manner as planned. It was also a mistake to inform the men in detail what support to expect in the attack because when the promised support failed to materialize they became reluctant to advance.

The Americans were insufficiently trained. They either went over the top in groups, not singly in face of the heavy machine gun fire, or refused to go over at all and had to be forced to do so at pistol point by Lieutenant Wattis, Brigade Staff Officer, who even tried to force the machine gunners to go over the top. [This is when the Lincoln "mutinied."—S. V.]

Stamber, Political Commissar, was nowhere to be seen during the attack. After the attack on the 23rd, Stamber suddenly discovered that there were a lot of improvements to be made in the cookhouse behind the lines and accordingly stayed there.

The Fascists showed their weakness in not counterattacking after the February 23 attack. Our attack on the 27th was the first counterattack against the Fascist drive to cut the Madrid-Valencia road.

The attack on the 27th had a strong positive feature. When the Fascists saw so many new troops advance on such a narrow front they became scared of the unexpectedly strong forces opposing them. They eased their pressure and stopped their advance. The Madrid-Valencia road was saved.
