Kovess and I came to see much of each other; he would drop in on me whenever he could snatch a free evening from his crowded routine. As the secretary of the Hungarian Bureau he was the leader of all Hungarian Communists in the United States and Canada, directing and supervising all their activities. He was also responsible for setting editorial policy for the <em>Uj Elore</em>, the Hungarian Communist daily, and writing editorials for it. In addition, the Central Committee of the Party had charged him with the task of involving the Hungarian Communists in general party work as part of the process of "Americanization" of the Communist Party, the membership of which, at that time in 1929, was overwhelmingly foreign born. His visits to me were his momentary escapes from the constant pressure he was under and I encouraged him to come and relax. This was my first experience with a real flesh and blood Communist leader and I found him the most stimulating intellect I had met until that time. He would challenge my every concept of society with biting comment and pungent observation, approaching every problem from a fresh slant and with startling originality.

The key to this insight, as he explained, was the Marxian dialectical approach. To acquire this slant, reading Marx alone as I had done under his urging, was not enough—it had to become "part of one's blood through participation in the class struggle." Marx had merely developed the basic laws governing society, namely, that all social institutions have grown out of the eternal struggle between the masters and the slaves, between the exploiter and the exploited, and explained the methods by which the ruling classes have successfully managed to mask the depraved character of their activities behind a veil of hypocrisy. To penetrate that mask required a constant probing into the question: "Whose economic interests are being served?" However, a person militantly involved in the class struggle no longer had to grope for this answer, he developed it automatically in the course of fighting the class enemy.

One night the talk turned to the concept of an ideal society. I maintained that Communism was a utopian dream. Kovess challenged that. His Communist society was beautiful in concept and plausible. He painted an enchanting picture.

In a Communist society every person would have an equal right to a full share of the products of that society. With private profit eliminated, the productivity of such a society would grow so plentiful that working time would be cut to four hours a day, possibly even less. Leisure time would be taken up by hobbies, most of them socially useful.

There would be no hoarding of goods for it would make no sense. Where a person was free to go to a warehouse and draw at any time whatever clothes or supplies he needed, he would find it not only silly but also a bother to load himself up with, let's say, a dozen suits and clutter up his home with them, to brush them, clean them and otherwise personally take care of them. He would take what he needed and come back for more at another time. Those who liked to see themselves surrounded by clothes, goods, or foodstuff would be made happy by being permitted to clerk in a store.

Thieves—there wouldn't be any. No one steals a sea shell off the beach. If he wants to bother carrying it home it is there for the taking. If he wanted a particular shell that someone had already picked up, he could be trained as a small infant can, to recognize that certain toys belong to an older brother and sister, and to look for some other shell for himself.

What about rare objects, masterpieces, a unique location on a lakeside, mountain top or seashore? People's tastes vary. Not everyone likes a mountain top; the climbing may be too steep for some. Others find the seashore too monotonous, too humid, the frozen lake too cold and desolate in the winter. Objects in great demand and strongly desired would be placed in the public domain, masterpieces hung in public halls for all people to enjoy.

Criminals, homicidal maniacs, sex perverts are sick people-they would be medically treated.

Money was an artificial incentive, developed as a convenient medium of exchange in a culture based on private ownership. Greed was a by-product of that culture. As Lenin said, come the revolution the public urinals may as well be lined with gold as with any other metal.

Capitalism rested on the incentive of monetary reward and on punishment by starvation. Yet even in a capitalist society it wasn't money which drove men to perform the most valued, most respected, socially most important acts.

Does a mother nurse her child, change his diapers, because she expects pay for her services?

Does a father stay up all night with his sick child because he expects a cash bonus for it?

Does a volunteer rush into a burning building to save his neighbor's life because he expects to tender a bill for it later?

How much cash did the man who did not know how to swim demand in advance before he jumped off the dock to try to save a floundering child and who himself drowned in the attempt?

What is the cash value of a Congressional Medal of Honor?

How much money did the early Christian martyrs demand for refusing to say <em>"Ave Caesar"</em> and for letting themselves be mangled to death by the hungry lions?

Does a medical missionary elect to practice among the aborigines in the jungle, instead of among the well-to-do in the suburbs, because he expects to gain a higher annual income?

Men give their best for pride in achievement, for their inner satisfaction and peace of mind; to win the approval, praise, and admiration of their fellow human beings. A Communist society would bestow all those rewards and, consequently, because money would not be needed for a medium of exchange, the abolishment of money would cause not a ripple in the social fabric.

Would people be happier in a Communist society?

Kovess hedged on that. All unhappiness caused by poverty, by inequality and social discrimination, by lack of opportunity, by lack of freedom, would simply disappear when their underlying economic causes had been removed.

I found the chink in the armor and pressed it hard.

What about other causes of unhappiness? What if a man loved a girl who preferred another? What if a man was born ugly? What if a man wanted to be a great painter, writer, composer and he simply did not have it in him? What if some people wanted to sleep at night while others wanted to make music?

Kovess brushed all that aside. There would always be individual problems. That was a matter of education, it belonged to the field of psychological research which would eventually yield the solution.

A Communist society would be a happy society, the only possible happy society. It was an historically most desirable goal, the good society of the future. It was practical, feasible, and therefore historically inevitable.

It was an enchanting vision. There was still more to it. This conception of an ideal society was no longer a dream. It was in the process of realization right then in the Soviet Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the elite guard of the proletariat. The Communist Party was destined to lead the downtrodden masses into similar revolts all over the world when the right historical moment arrived. Kovess then urged it was high time I quit my ivory tower and took an active part in remaking society, handed me an application card, and invited me to join the Communist Party.

I was entranced. Although the sweatshop in which I worked could hardly be classified as an ivory tower, the vision held out by Kovess was truly inspiring. This was the purpose in life I had been searching for-to help elevate mankind—and now I was offered a chance to participate in it.

In the light of my subsequent experiences it would be easy to claim, as so many ex-Communists have done, that "I was duped." I hadn't been duped, nor was anyone else who ever joined the Communist Party. This is particularly true of those former Communists who joined the Party in the thirties when the great depression laid bare the glaring injustices, brutality, and fundamental weaknesses of predatory capitalism. Each of them, like me, had been led to the party by the vision of a perfect future society, each was motivated by the wish to become, as Kovess had put it, "one of the architects of the happy society of the future." I know I was. When I took that application card I was merely worried about one thing—whether my character was sufficiently strong to brave the hardships and hazards of the class struggle—whether I was indeed ready to sacrifice my material well-being for such a remote ideal. Well, time would tell, I might as well give it a try, I reasoned, as I signed the application card. Kovess was greatly pleased.

"I knew from the moment I met you that you were the right Party material, only I didn't anticipate it would take you this long to come along."

We then went for a walk and Kovess explained that since I knew English he would turn my application over to the New York District for assignment in general party work. This would put me in the mainstream of the American mass revolutionary movement. I was awed by the prospect.

We were just rounding the corner to Gramercy Park when a policeman passed us. Kovess suddenly grabbed my arm in a nervous clutch and I saw his entire body grow tense. I became worried and asked what was wrong.

Kovess' eyes were distended with hatred and he started to revile that policeman under his breath, the first time I heard him curse.

I was astounded. That patrolman seemed a nice, rather friendly looking young man and I told that to Kovess. His voice in reply was harsh.

"Police are all bastard breeds, born inhuman monsters. No humans, only beasts, could be induced to seize their fellow creatures made of flesh and blood and keep them locked behind bars, to deprive human beings of their freedom which is more precious than life itself."

I was deeply impressed. That view of a policeman's function was rather new to me. Thus spoke a real Communist, a true champion of human freedom. I wondered would I ever develop such a spontaneous recognition of all threats to liberty.



A few months after that incident Kovess was transferred to Moscow to work in the Comintern. About a year later he sent me a card from a sanatorium in the Crimea; he was critically ill and his lung had been collapsed in an attempt to save his life from the further ravages of tuberculosis.

That was the last I heard about him until the late forties, long after I had quit the Party, when by chance I encountered one of my former comrades who had just returned from Hungary. After describing the brilliant careers achieved by those of our comrades who returned to Hungary after the Communists took power, he suddenly asked:

"Of course, you know about Kovess, don't you?"

"Is he still alive?" I exclaimed in astonishment. I had thought him long dead of tuberculosis.

"I should say he is. He is back from Moscow and he holds one of the most responsible jobs in the country. He is in charge of all the concentration camps in Hungary!" he added impressively.

"What?" I exclaimed incredulously.

He repeated it and added that Kovess was doing a terrific job.

I burst out in explosive laughter and I laughed uncontrollably until my breath came in gasps and I realized I wasn't really laughing at all. I was back in Spain at the time of the Civil War, my mind on the overcrowded SIM jail in Albacete in the Guardia Nacional, bent on the hopeless errand of rescuing one of our American volunteers from the clutches of the Communist secret police. I have never forgotten those verminous cells jammed full beyond their capacity, with barely enough space to stretch out on the cold stone floor. The nauseating stench of that human cage in that Communist prison suddenly filled my nostrils again and transported me to Communist Hungary.

 . . . Two o'clock in the morning, when body resistance is lowest.

A loud knock at the door. Rough voices demanding: "Open up!" Men in black leather coats with machine pistols drawn ransacking the apartment, ripping open mattresses, tearing down curtains. A wife or mother near hysteria and panic, crying children cowering in fright. A rough shove implemented by a kick with a boot: "Get moving, you filthy imperialist swine." The torture chambers of AVO in every Hungarian town, the crushing of fingertips, the squeezing of genitals, whips savagely slashing the naked buttocks of prisoners: "CONFESS, CONFESS!"

Electrified barbed wire with machine gun towers; armed sentries patrolling with savage police dogs unleashed at their side. Inside the concentration camps half-starved wretches writhing in their sleep in dread of the morrow; toiling from dawn to dark like slaves of old under the lash of well-fed, warmly clad brutal overseers. Lording over them all stands the Chief Warden of all the concentration camps in Hungary, Comrade Kovess, patting the Order of Lenin and the Red Star of Rakosi on his breast that he has just received for doing a "terrific job."

That Chief Warden with the master whip, that Red Simon Legree, is Comrade Louis Kovess who some twenty odd years ago had told me in Gramercy Park that no humans, only beasts, could be induced to seize their fellow creatures made of flesh and blood and keep them locked behind bars, that human freedom is more precious than life itself.

It couldn't be, yet it was. It added up. It was dialectics.

Yet there was more to it.

This was dialectics with a vengeance!
