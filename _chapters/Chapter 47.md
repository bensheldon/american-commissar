Fiala and I soon established a satisfactory working relationship. Although he and my other colleagues on the Commission Commission were content to wait docilely until the "documents" from the combat units of the I.B. arrived he had no objection, in principle, against my going after them in person provided I promised to keep him out of trouble and accepted the responsibility for my individual action. That suited me fine. There was but one drawback. Fiala either couldn't or wouldn't get a <em>Salvo Conducto</em> for me from the Base Military Command and was horrified at the suggestion that as <em>Jefe</em> the I.B. Historical Commission he should issue me one on his own authority.

If he was worried about acting as a <em>Jefe</em>, I wasn't. I was a <em>Jefe</em> too, "Chief of the Anglo-American Section," so I decided to have some official letterheads printed, talked a worried engraver into making a rubber stamp for the Historical Commission without official authorization, and issued my own <em>Salvo Conducto</em>. I signed it myself, then stamped it—that's all there was to it. Fiala was jittery over this unprecedented act but I mollified him by presenting that stamp to him for the use of the Historical Commission. He was certain that pass wouldn't be honored but he proved wrong. I traveled with that <em>Salvo Conducto</em> all over Spain, into every war zone where the Internaional Brigades fought, without having it challenged once and it gave me entry into all headquarters I cared to visit.

The pass I drew up was simple. It was typed on a letterhead which bore in print the heading:

<blockquote markdown=1>

<center>
HISTORICAL COMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL BRIGADES
<em>Salvo Conducto</em>
</center>

Permission is hereby granted to Comrade Sandor Voros, Chief of the Anglo-American Section of the Historical Commission of the International Brigades, to visit all units of the International Brigades. Comrade Voros is on an important and confidential mission for the Historical Commission of the International Brigades.

The commanders of all army units are requested to facilitate his travel and to give him their utmost co-operation for the successful fulfillment of his mission.

<em>(Stamped)</em>
Historical Commission of the International Brigades

<em>(Stamped again for good measure)</em>

<em>(Signed)</em> Sandor Voros
Chief of the Anglo-American Section of the Historical Commission of the International Brigades
</blockquote>

I had that translated into Spanish by our interpreter who added a few <em>muchisimos</em> and a couple of flowery phrases of his own volition, and I was in business.

My first trip was to Tarazona to visit Joe Dallet; I was eager to see him for old friendship's sake. I was also disturbed about the rumors circulating about him in Albacete which I found difficult to credit and I wanted to see for myself.

The first complaint I heard about Dallet was voiced by Jack Delehenty who had delivered Joe's note to me in Almansa. Delehenty pleaded with me to have him transferred out of Dallet's unit to the artillery (eventually I managed to arrange that) because of Dallet's intolerable dictatorial behavior. Delehenty claimed that Dallet was universally hated by all men in the training camp. Jack was a young boy about twenty and I did not take his opinion seriously, but later in Albacete I met up with many other volunteers from Tarazona who were unanimous in their condemnation of Dallet, which made me wonder.

I had known Joe Dallet for years. The last time I saw him in Youngstown he was still the hard-working, somewhat naive, solemn young organizer rather on the shy side who had often been criticized by the District for his lack of aggressive leadership.

I couldn't make that picture of Joe jibe with the ones presented of him by those men.

I did not know then how quickly and easily power can corrupt—especially Communists who are conditioned to it.
