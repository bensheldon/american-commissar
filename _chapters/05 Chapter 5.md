Toward the end of September, 1918, our allies manifested signs of treachery; the Turks and Bulgarians were negotiating for a separate peace. Worse still, trouble was brewing among the population right in Hungary itself.

Budapest was placed under summary law under General Lukasits. To stop the alarming rate of desertions, soldiers guilty of repeated desertions were ordered to be hanged.

Thousands upon thousands of Hungarian prisoners of war in Russia who had escaped from prison camps following the Bolshevik revolution and painfully made their way on foot thousands of miles back to Hungary, were being kept in "decontamination camps" to purge them of the "bacilli of Bolshevism." A number of those considered to have been "infected by the disease" were summarily hanged.

Rigid censorship kept most of these developments secret. My information came from Keresztessy's friends. They heard it discussed in their family circles to which many high-ranking army officers, members of the Upper House, and high government officials belonged.

The evil mind behind all these horrible developments, as they discussed it, was Count Michael Károlyi, owner of the largest landed estate in Hungary, a member of the oldest aristocracy. Back from his internment in France, he took up his old tricks of rabble rousing. Count Károlyi advocated the formation of a separate Hungarian Kingdom and negotiation of peace with the Allies. This was high treason. But he did not stop there. He was urging land reforms, the division of the large landed estates which constituted the largest percentage of all the land in Hungary. From what I gathered, this proposal to divide the land among the peasants far transcended treason to Emperor and Country; it violated the divine order of the Universe itself.

As I listened to the conversations around me with the uncritical ears of my youth and ignorance, I became utterly fascinated by the evil character of Count Károlyi as it was unfolded to me. He was said to be syphilitic, his brains softened by paresis, the last stage of syphilis. He couldn't even talk normally because his larynx and his upper palate had rotted away due to that disease. the brother-in-law of one of the cadets was a first cousin of Károlyi, and he personally knew that to be a fact.

(Eighteen years later, during the 1936 presidential campaign, I was to hear the very same accusations in almost identical terms, except that they were spoken in English then. This time these slanders were leveled against another man—the President of the United States, another great man who had the compassion to disassociate himself from the narrow interests of his own social class in order to advance the welfare of the entire nation.)

The last days of October, 1918 found our artillery base in a "state of alarm." We were standing by day and night as the only troops absolutely loyal to King and Country the Budapest authorities could depend on to suppress the threatening disorders in the capital. We were cadets and each and every one of us was greatly outraged by the treasonable activities going on in Budapest. We were equipped with both field guns and howitzers and itching to put them to use.

On October 30, we received orders to march. As gun commander of a 75-mm. fieldpiece I was swelling with pride and responsibility. We were briefly told that Budapest was in danger of being taken over by the rabble. We were to draw up with our guns in front of the Parliament and other public buildings and, if the mob would not disperse, fire on them at point-blank range. Those orders excited and pleased us. We recalled Napoleon and expected to do even better than he.

We left our barracks under the command of a newly assigned general. Our artillery was horse-drawn and as our column moved out officers and gun commanders were mounted, artillerymen were seated on their caissons. I was elated. I pictured myself with my gun saddling an avenue, giving an order to fire, the mob fleeing in disorder, falling to the ground like wheat being mowed, just like in the heroic paintings. It did not enter my mind that what I was so eagerly anticipating was the butchery of my own fellow citizens. What I saw in my mind's eye was the "mob," an abstract concept of traitorous rabble.

By ten in the morning we reached the outskirts of Budapest and there was a long halt. It was a sunny, cheerful, unseasonably mild fall day, the kind especially ordered by the gods for the kind of heroic action we were about to perform, yet, inexplicably, we were just standing still. Our horses were getting restless and we too were getting bored.

The general and his staff were huddled in a council of war about a hundred yards ahead. There was a constant coming and going, staff officers were constantly being dispatched to the city, others were arriving from there. Emissaries of all kinds, including high-ranking artillery and infantry officers, were coming and going, but in general there seemed to be a desultory air about all that traffic. Something appeared to be lacking which puzzled me until I discovered what it was—there was no "snap to" in it. We sensed that the Command was hesitant, indecisive, unduly cautious, even timid. The staff officers passing along our column looked preoccupied, slouching down in their saddles forgetful of their military bearing. There was no vehicular traffic on that very broad cobblestoned road. The few civilians on the side walks appeared to have a festive air about them, many were in their Sunday best hastening toward the heart of the city.

Time was stretching out. The artillerymen, without orders to permit it, got off their hard, uncomfortable iron seats and lounged around their guns and ammunition wagons, whispering to each other. One of the cadets dismounted, also without orders, on his own initiative. The other cadets, myself included, frowned on this breach of discipline. Minutes later, when nothing had I to him, other cadets followed his example. Soon all dismounted, including me.

After a while our own colonel passed by, riding slowly toward of the column. We all stiffened, scared, but he did not appear to see us; that hard disciplinarian and martinet failed to notice the definitely sloppy appearance of that previously proud martial column, even though by now, to use his own favorite expression, we definitely looked like a "bunch of civilian whores lolling under a red light, awaiting their pimps."

Shortly afterward there was a commotion up front. An automobile from the city came to a halt there. Some civilians alighted and went up to the general. They talked a while with him and then the general stepped aside, called over his staff, and they went into a short consultation. Afterward, the general got into the car with two of his aides and drove off toward the city. The rest of the officers gathered around the two civilians who had remained behind and there was an animated conversation.

Time became an unmoving vast cloud, dull, unstretching, and never ending. I was getting hungry and so was everybody else. Since we hadn't hitched up our food wagons, there was no promise of either food or fodder. The horses were getting very restless standing there in harness.

After an eternity of just standing around listlessly, I became aware of people in the distance, civilians approaching from the city, moving toward us. They were walking down the center of the road in small groups, but as the first groups advanced the road behind them filled up with more and more people. They were shouting as they approached but it sounded friendly, more like cheering. Then an automobile came weaving through the crowd with its horn blowing constantly, followed by about six other autos. They reached us before the people did. The cars pulled up in front of our column. A civilian jumped out and said something to our colonel who immediately jumped into the car. The other officers all came running. They crowded into the cars, a few of them even stood on the running boards. The cars turned around and headed back to the city. A captain who had reached there too late rode alongside me on his horse. We were on friendly terms and I asked him what was going on, when did we expect to march? He looked furious.

"March, muck!" he answered with an oath. "The bastards all scurried away to swear allegiance to the National Council."

"To the leaders of the rabble?" I asked in a shock. "That's treason!"

The captain was not listening, he was looking toward the city. Finally he burst out.

"You'd think the bastards would find room for another fellow officer. They could always crowd one more in." With that he stuck his spurs savagely into his horse's flanks and galloped away.

The crowd was very near now and we could distinguish the cheers.

"<em>Viva! Viva!</em> Long live the National Council! Long live our brave artillery. <em>Viva</em> for Hungary! Hooray for the National Council! Hooray for the artillery!"

The artillerymen left the column and advanced to meet the crowd. In no time at all the crowd was all around us, enveloping us, absorbing us. Everyone was cheering and shouting, shaking hands, embracing, clapping shoulders like at a Hungarian village wedding. Then somebody called out in a loud, high voice:

"On to the National Council!" Others took up that cry. Every body was cheering and the crowd reversed its flow, moving back to the city. I held back and the crowd swirled past me. Soon the last one of them passed, hurrying to catch up. They were singing now and I followed them with my eyes for a distance. Then I turned around and looked back at our column.

There was our proud column stretched back as far as eye could see, field guns, howitzers, ammunition wagons, enough shells to shoot down half the population of Budapest—abandoned, without an officer or man in sight, the riding mounts tethered to the caissons, the draft horses left in harness unattended, deserted. Without giving it conscious thought I foraged through a few ammunition wagons until in one of them I came across some hard sausage and bread someone had hidden there. I took them. I saw an abandoned carbine and I picked that up too, slung it around my shoulder. I did not know what made me take it, for I had my heavy saber hanging at my side. Perhaps I dimly sensed that when things are in ferment a carbine is a handy thing to have. That done, I started my own trek toward the city.

I did not know then that I had just witnessed the final dissolution of the once mighty, centuries-old Austro-Hungarian Empire! Nor could I possibly guess in my ignorance that I was also an eyewitness to something far more fundamental to the organization of human society.

I saw how an armed force could evaporate without firing a single shot in its own defense, how an established government could be cowed into submission merely by the threat of violence.

I was an eyewitness to how state power disintegrates under the hot breath of revolution!
