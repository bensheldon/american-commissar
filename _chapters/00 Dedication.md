<pre>
FOR THOSE
	Whose recollections of the violent events that presaged
		The Shape of Things to Come
	Have grown rather dim.
		More particularly
FOR THOSE
	Born during and after World War II;
	The New Generation, confused by the distorted claims of
		The wicked Righteousness, and
		The righteous Wickedâ€”
	Who find it difficult to distinguish
		Which is which, and
		Which is worse,
	Yet who are fated to determine whither mankind.

FOR THEIR
	Clearer comprehension of the
	Vision and Despair which motivated so many in the 
	Era (not yet at an end), this
	Leftward trail in pursuit of a
	Better World has been retraced from memory
		and
	Faithfully recorded.
