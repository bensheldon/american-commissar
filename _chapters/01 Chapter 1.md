It could have been eleven in the morning or one in the afternoon, it was hard to tell which by the hot Spanish sun. The last glimpse I'd had of the map was two nights before, too long ago to do me much good. Besides, our maps were not too dependable. I tried to recall where due north was but couldn't. I had lost my orientation in the last bombardment and one mountain top looked very much like another. It felt still early and a long day lay ahead.

The road below had been cut. Nothing had come through past the bend to the left for hours, since I saw that camion blown up. That was accurate shooting, three shells landing short, three shells right on target. That couldn't have been Franco artillery. It must have been one of those new Nazi automatic batteries Captain Smirčka had described to me which the Nazis were trying out for the first time in Spain. I had never seen them in action before.

The Stukas were dive-bombing to the right—roar, crash, burst—ripping black columns of smoke out of the heaving ground.

Enriquez, the battalion <em>enlacé</em>, was dead and so was the other new Spanish runner whose name I hadn't caught. The Spanish company, most of them stragglers we had managed to round up during the night and placed here in reserve, had bolted with the first shelling, giving away our position. It takes good training to hold troops under prolonged artillery fire. The Spaniards we had been getting as replacements lately were raw green recruits with only rudimentary training. Thrown in as fast as they arrived they never had a chance. They did not do us much good either.

Mortars were now landing on top of the mountain where out Spanish 24th battalion was holding and the sound of machine guns was heavy. It was high time for me to get up there to check with the battalion commissar. I started up. Then it dawned on me that there was something wrong with the sound of that machine-gun fire. I listened intently and then I knew. Our answering fire was lacking. The battalion must have withdrawn—evidently somewhere to the right. That would account for the dive-bombing over that spot, for we had positioned no troops there.

The Fascist artillery opened up again, exploding at random along the mountainside. Although I found fairly good cover in a hollow I was beginning to get jittery. Bombing and strafing I could take, the suspense was usually over before there was time to work up panic, but artillery fire was different. I feared shelling more because I knew something about artillery. Fortunately for me, Franco's artillery had been rather poor when I was first exposed to their fire so I was never bothered much by it. I was familiar with his field guns, archaic, pre-First World War models with rifle gun-sights, designed more for coping with domestic uprisings than for action in the field. The trainings of his artillerymen was poor, they did not have many shells, and they usually quit after firing a couple of dozen rounds.

This time it did not look as if they were about to quit. The bombardment grew in intensity and I discerned a definite pattern in it. It was developing into a regular area shelling in gridiron pattern, which definitely bespoke Nazi artillery. It meant the Fascists were getting ready to attack and this shelling was aimed at an interdiction of our reserves.

But we had no reserves. I was the only one alive on that mountainside. That made me the reserves.

<em>Name</em>: Sandor Voros.
<em>Age</em>: 37.
<em>Arms</em>: One Belgian automatic pistol, not official issue but a present from Joe Dallet, a former commissar and friend, long dead.
<em>Ammo</em>: One extra clip of bullets; one hand grenade for strictly personal use—avoid being captured alive and to take a few of the enemy with me.

There it was, that was the list. I was the reserves to hold that mountainside for the Loyalist Army. Now the thought, which I had persistently refused to recognize during all those days of the nightmarish Fascist offensive in Aragon in that spring of 1938, boldly emerged for the first time from behind the threshold of suppressed consciousness. It sprang forth stark and startlingly frank. This was death. The end of the trail, personally, for me.

The artillery was beginning to box me in. "Correction fifty meters ahead. Fire!" Four more shells. BINGO! Sic transit . . .

I felt the beginning of panic, the almost irresistible urge to bolt, but I fought it down quickly. I was not under direct observation, by staying put I still had a chance. Four more shells . . . There is no one-hundred per cent killing zone, only a ninety-five per cent one. That five per cent margin, that five per cent chance. The shells might be duds . . . That was Nazi artillery firing Nazi shells. The <em>Inprecor</em> article a little while back describing the sabotage in Nazi munition factories by the Communist underground . . . I smiled wryly. I wouldn't want to be taken in by our own propaganda. God! Please God. It was no go. I was a nonbeliever. Faith . . . Lord, it would be most comforting to believe in miracles, in the supernatural, to have You reach out . . .

Four more shells and it would be over, a matter of two minutes or less. I was going to die. I was going to be killed right here. I was going to die all alone, in faraway Spain, on a mountainside the name of which I did not even know.

My parents! They had no idea where I was. They would be spared grief. They would expect me to turn up as usual every few years or so. My brothers, my sisters, my girl, my friends...they would grieve. They would be waiting for news for a long time and then they would guess, give up hope.

The <em>Daily Worker</em>, the <em>Uj Elore</em> Hungarian Communist daily—to them it would be welcome news, one of their own killed in battle, fighting Fascism in Spain. My death would identify the Party press with me. That would be a good issue to tie in with their next campaign for subscriptions and contributions...So what! Were I in their place I would exploit the situation the same way.

It was a shame to have to die before our triumph over Fascism! Come on Sandor, cut that stuff out. Face it. What's so terrible about death? Let's reverse it. Suppose I were to come out alive, what then? What's so precious about me? I have lived a full live. I have eaten my fill, have drunk my share, have known love. I have laughed and I have grieved, have walked in the lead and have followed in turn. I have fought and I have argued, I have won and I have lost. I have read what others have published and I have been published for others to read. I have tasted applause and suffered slander. I have lived and now I would die. So what if I lived on! Life would be a repetition.

Why cry about it when it was a natural, logical progression for me to die here within the next few moments. Cause and effect. I was born in a certain era; developed ideas in a certain direction; adopted a certain code of conduct which led inevitably here, to this mountainside. Since I was here at this moment, it was logical that I should die. Saul Mills was right when he told of the demoralized Lincoln Battalion men: "What if it cost the international proletariat a hundred thousand lives to stop Fascism in Spain!" Of course Mills had only been visiting here and went right back home, yet I upheld his position to the men who bitched and protested.

"Why does it have to be us? Why not the lives of some other international proletarians?"

"Because you have volunteered to come here and because you are here,'" I lectured them, giving them no comfort. I had also volunteered to come here, I was here, and now it was my turn to die.

I had come a long way to be here. The trail began on that hot summer day in July, 1914, in Hungary when I, still in knee pants, was among the marching crowd cheering the Austro-Hungarian Declaration of War against Serbia, which initiated World War I. That trail eventually led to this mountain on the Aragon front where I, a one-time humanist and liberal, late of Cleveland, one of the leading members of the Communist Party in Ohio, presently Chief of the Commissariat of War of the XV International Brigade, was about to die because of my consistent sympathies with the underdog.

A wave of self-pity rushed over me and now I felt infinitely sad yet mentally at peace beneath the convusively mounting muscular tension as the screaming shell roared home. Concussion squeezed me till all was black, my lungs choked, the ground heaved, my eyeballs swelled to bursting, my nose was burning, my eardrums were clanging anvils, my throat was seared, falling earth was burying me, I was gagging and choking and struggling and gasping and alive. THE . . . NINETY-FIVE . . . PER . . . CENT . . . KILLING . . . ZONE ran like the <em>Times</em>' illuminated news ribbon before my blinded eyes. By the time I finished digging the earth off my head and neck only to duck back again, the next shells exploded safely offside.

It was approaching sunset. I sat up, already organizing in my mind the best place to set up a field kitchen, if I could locate one, for luring the scattered men out of their hiding places with the smell of hot food. My mind was on the problem of how to feed those men and hold them around the kitchen until we could get them back into the new line which would be improvised during the night. For that was the kind of war we were reduced to fighting and that was the way it was done.

Resolutely I cut my thoughts off from circling back to their previous channel, and it worked, but with one curious side effect. From that afternoon on I became indifferent to my fate. Not because of fear or the lack of it, but because I simply stopped caring. If I stayed alive, fine. If not, so what!

That indifference to my own fate, however, set up an unanticipated subconscious reaction. I found myself growing more concerned with the welfare of human beings in the singular instead of the abstract "masses." Subsequently this led to my reappraisal of Communist theory in the light of its practical application as I had witnessed it, especially in Spain.

That was the turning point. It had been a long road from a soft humanist to a hard-boiled Communist although the signpost had been clearly marked and I had many eager guides to beckon me on. The road back was uncharted and lonely, the tracks faint and uncertain. It has been rough going, not without its perils. I am still being barred from reaching my objective—nor can I tell for how long.
