<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17" title="dingbat" src="http://americancommissar.wordpress.com/files/2009/01/dingbat.png" alt="dingbat" width="25" height="108" />The usual image the word "revolution" evokes is that of violent turbulence: a disturbed wasp's nest buzzing viciously; a vortex of cascading waters that churn furiously; an onrush of drunk-maddened cutthroats with long knives dripping blood-a furious, hysterical, bloodthirsty mob jamming streets and squares, packing them solid with howling flesh that permits no one to escape.

There was no such image in my mind as, munching absently on my sausage and bread, I made my way on foot to the inner city where I expected the National Council to be. That broad, miles-long, cobblestoned principal thoroughfare was completely deserted. Only here and there did I encounter a solitary figure on the sidewalk. I was in no hurry. I recall finding a half-consumed apple on the curb and kicking it forward until it broke into pieces, and then kicking the pieces until there was nothing left to kick.

As I neared the center of the city I saw more and more people, then crowds of them. They were all hurrying in the same direction. An open truck full of people shouting and cheering veered in from one of the side streets. The truck was slowing down for the turn; I held up my arm, the driver stopped, and a dozen eager hands reached down to help me up into the truck. A poorly dressed woman hugged me. Someone yelled:

"Hooray for the armed soldier of the revolution!"

They all cheered and then someone burst into a rousing song in which other voices joined. The song had a quick, thrilling rhythm. I was told it was the Marseillaise, the forbidden anthem of the Social-Democrats.

I felt uncomfortable and out of place. Those around me looked like factory hands and, as a cadet, I did not know how to act in such close proximity to them. But they were very friendly, their arms around each other's shoulders. Someone put his arm around my shoulders and I in turn put my arm around someone else's. Soon I caught myself also humming the Marseillaise. We were in the heart of Budapest now and the streets were getting so thick with people that the truck was barely able to crawl. After a while it became completely immobilized.

I got off and headed in the direction of the National Council. The nearer I approached, the more difficult it became to make headway, but it did not matter. I was not really going anywhere. I was simply moving into the heart of things, drawn by half-formed curiosity and the natural gravitational pull of the crowds.

By the time I reached the building, the crowd was very dense. We stood on the street and waited, for what, none of us really knew. Time was a white-bearded, pleasant old man pausing serenely with us. Every once in a while some civilian wearing a large rosette made of silk ribbon in the Hungarian national colors of red, white, and green, would step out on the balcony and make a short speech. The speaker would invariably be received with rousing cheers although nobody could hear what he was saying. When I would inquire of my neighbors who that speaker might be, nobody would know, nor were they able to tell me what he had said. It did not seem to matter to them. They evidently took it for granted that the speaker had said what they wanted to hear.

The crowd was composed mainly of civilians, men and women, with a small sprinkling of soldiers in uniform, none of whom were armed. After a while I found myself on the sidewalk, near the entrance to the building. The crowd kept a narrow lane open in front and I watched a long procession of officers enter the building.

The officers were of all branches of the service, infantry, artillery, supply, signal corps, transport. They were of diverse ranks, most of them lieutenants and captains, only a few majors. Whenever a high ranking officer, a lieutenant colonel or colonel, entered he was cheered by the crowd. I observed that the military men were not a cohesive group—they did not act under orders, they had come individually and alone. They carried their sabers but no other arms. When I asked what those officers were doing in there I was told they were swearing allegiance to the National Council, that the Council required this of all officers, in fact had issued an order to that effect.

I was only a cadet, the embryo of an officer, neither fish nor fowl, halfway between the officers and men. A cadet outranked all enlisted men and noncoms and was officially a gentleman with the caste privileges of an officer, but not yet one. I could not figure out whether that order applied to me also. (It never occurred to me to question whether such an order had actually been issued, and if so, by what authority the National Council had issued such orders to the Army. Many years later, in Spain, I was to find that in a chaotic situation anybody could issue an order on his own authority and if that order coincided with the general mood, if it expressed and crystallized it, then that order would be repeated by many mouths, transmitted all along the line, and obeyed. When it was contrary to the general feeling, such an order would be listened to with indifference, not repeated, and end up discarded along with similar thousands of others.)

Standing there among the mob became tedious after a while and I decided I might as well go upstairs and present myself, see what was going on. By that time there was a lull, the steady procession of officers had slowed down to a trickle, evidently few officers had been left unsworn. As I elbowed my way to the entrance somebody shouted:

"Hooray for the armed officer of the revolution!"

A loud cheer went up and I blushed. I felt self-conscious and my legs moved clumsily. The shout brought several people to the head of the inside stairs, all of them civilians wearing large cockards made of silk ribbons, also a woman in a light gray houndstooth suit. They were smiling down on me as I climbed the stairs, and the woman applauded.

When I reached the top landing the woman threw her arms around me and kissed me on the cheek. The men shook hands with me.

"Here is one loyal officer the National Council can depend on," one of the men said and slapped me on the shoulder. "He even brought his rifle along to defend us," said another one, beaming in approval. I wanted to correct him but I didn't. Mine was a carbine, not a rifle, but he was a civilian and wouldn't know the difference.

The woman pinned a rosette on me. She picked one of the larger ones out of a wicker basket on the floor, but not nearly as big as the ones they were wearing. Mine was made of narrower ribbons, nor did the ends hang down as low as theirs.

We went into a larger room and they questioned me about my unit. When they learned I was from the Artillery Officers School in Kobanya one of them told me that mine was the unit they had been most apprehensive about, because they did not know how deeply the spirit of the National Council had penetrated our base. Had we not come over, who knows what might have happened.

Another, older man then cut in and told him witheringly that he had erred, that he failed to appraise properly the war-weary spirit and revolutionary ardor which had permeated the army. Here was that young man, he pointed to me, a cadet, the very embodiment of military spirit and indoctrination, yet he had even brought his arms along to defend the National Council. I felt very self-conscious, I never liked to be praised to my face; besides, the way they talked about me was rather unwarranted. I had not taken that carbine to defend anything, I had simply picked it up because I thought it was a good thing to have around. My carbine wasn't even loaded. I had forgotten to check it or take any ammunition along.

The two men fell into arguing, the others joined in and there I was, completely ignored. I walked out and wandered around the corridor, looking into the other rooms. All of them were crowded with civilians and high-ranking officers engaged in excited debates or deep in discussion, and I quickly withdrew trying to appear as inconspicuous as possible. Obviously I did not belong, there was nothing for me to do in that place. I drifted through the building, walked down the steps to the side entrance, and went outside.

By then it was late afternoon and the crowd was considerably thinned out, one could walk around freely. I heard shouts and noticed people running, all in one direction. I ran, too. Soon I was gaining on them and even outdistancing all but a few ahead of me, but no one could tell me what was going on. In order to sprint faster I was carrying my carbine in my right hand, the regulation way of going into attack. I was soon in the lead when I saw another group standing in front of a store, pointing down a side street where a few other people were running and yelling to me excitedly, "Looters, looters!"

It was a jewelry shop with its iron shutter forced halfway up, and the show window smashed. I did not pause but kept on running to catch up with five or six civilians who were chasing three looters. At the next block the looters separated. One ran down a side street and I followed him while the civilians kept after the other two. I was gaining on him rapidly and finally cornered him in a doorway before he had a chance to slip into the building. He was a tough-looking boy of about seventeen; he was all out of breath and he thrust a gold watch out to me. As I took it he suddenly yelled, "Look out!"

I turned around involuntarily and he bolted and ran diagonally across the street. I was about to take after him again, then gave up—after all, I had recovered the looted watch. Breathing hard, I walked back to the jewelry store. By the time I got there the shop was black with people. They were shoving and pushing, all the showcases were smashed, and the floor was crunchy with broken glass. A short fat man and a tall skinny one were tugging at a large silver tray, another was hugging a large silver pitcher to his stomach with his left arm and flailing about him with his right, fighting his way out of the melee. Those who had managed to get hold of something were fighting to get out while others kept pushing and shoving, trying to get in. I had come back to the store to return the watch, but certainly these were not the proper people to take it. Every one of them in there was looting by now. In a few minutes the store was stripped bare and the people were scurrying away. I stood there for a while waiting for a policeman to come around so I could hand him that watch but none showed up. Some other people came who kept asking me what had happened. I got tired of answering them and I walked away also. On my way I examined the watch. It had a golden lid and when I pressed the stem it opened, revealing the Greek letter Omega on its face. My father had an Omega watch and I knew it was expensive. I stuck the watch in the pocket of my tunic and buttoned the flap down; I was wondering what to do with it and did not want to be held responsible for losing it.

As I was walking along slowly considering what to do next, a black limousine drew up to the curb and stopped near me. Four soldiers were riding in it, two of them carrying rifles and two unarmed. A chauffeur in a black private uniform was at the wheel. The two unarmed soldiers got out, shook hands with the other two, and departed. I went over to the car and got into the vacant front seat, next to the chauffeur. No one said anything, but they were watching me. I said nothing either and the chauffeur started the car.

"Where are you going?" I asked the chauffeur. He glanced at me. "I don't know," he said miserably. "Wherever those two drunks want me to take them." He told me they had commandeered his car that forenoon and that the car was owned by a member of the Upper House of Parliament. He told his name but it did not register with me.

I stretched out luxuriously, for that was the first time in my life I had ever sat in an automobile. Of all the events of that day the realization that I was riding in an automobile was what impressed me the most.

We rode around aimlessly. The two drunks in the back were singing and frequently one or the other would poke his rifle through the window and fire in the air. They offered me a drink out of their bottle and when I refused they taunted me, calling me a baby. I was not a baby. I was a man. I was fully eighteen years and three months old. I had taken drinks before and I would have liked to take one then. But I was obliged to refuse. It was against regulations for cadets to drink with enlisted men.

After a while their bottle was empty and their ammunition spent. By now it was dusk. The soldiers asked to be driven to a certain corner and got out. That left me alone with the chauffeur who eyed me warily.

I pulled out my remaining bread and sausage, for I was hungry again, and offered to share it with him. He was only a chauffeur but being a civilian that was not improper. He accepted eagerly.

"This is the first bite I've had since morning," he told me.

While eating we took counsel together. He told me that his boss had fled to his country estate and he wondered what he was expected to do. He had very little benzine left.

I offered to take care of him and said I would even get him benzine from our base. I had nothing specific in mind, but I wanted to postpone parting with the car as long as possible. The chauffeur was single, tubercular, and hence unfit for the army. He said he was very poorly paid. The chauffeur drove me to Kobanya to my apartment. We reached there late in the evening.

Keresztessy and his belongings were gone. He had left a note for me on the table. It was brief.

"Adieu! old pal!" the note read. "I scooted home. Pater will need me there to help him keep an eye on the peasants. I took your pistol and left you the salami, also the jug of rum. You can get another pistol here while I won't need food at home. . . ."

I didn't mind about the pistol. It was army issue. I was glad about the salami. The chauffeur's lips began to twitch when his eyes fell on it. I invited him to eat all he wanted and by the time he had finished I had to stand on tiptoes to reach the salami to cut a slice for myself. I ate, too, but not nearly as much as the chauffeur, and we washed it down with rum. I let the chauffeur sleep in Keresztessy's bed. He liked the bed very much. He told me he did not have a room, all he could afford was to rent a bed in the family of a baker. He had the use of the bed at night while the baker was away working. The baker in turn had the bed during the day, a very common arrangement among the working people in Budapest.

Before we fell asleep I remembered the watch and showed it to him. He was very excited about it; he kept opening and closing it, breathing on it and polishing it. He wanted to know what I intended to do with it.

"Turn it over to the police, of course," I told him. He said the police would steal it, it would never get back to the owner. He said he knew where that jewelry store was and volunteered to keep the watch until he found a chance to return it to the owner of the store personally. I was very glad of the solution. He was really a very accommodating chap, saving me further bother about that watch.

The next morning we rose early and bathed. The chauffeur was grateful and even obsequious. That was the first time he had had a bath in a private tub, he told me. He looked very skinny undressed, all skin and bones, his ribs and his shoulder blades sticking out. He was coughing a great deal.

We drove over to the base. It, too, was deserted, not a single officer or cadet around. There were a few artillerymen loafing around the stables but no horses or guns were in sight. I wondered about the horses, I supposed they had been stolen, simply unhitched from the column and led away. I hoped that had happened, that they had not been left standing there in harness thirsty and starving. I talked to some of the men. They had no homes to go to and said that was why they had come back. I found the benzine and we filled the tank.

"Now where to?" asked the chauffeur. I did not know.

"Let's go to the National Council," I said, remembering that woman there, thinking she might have something for us to do.

As we were driving into town many soldiers tried to stop us, attempting to get on. I waved them all off with the carbine. This time it was loaded.

As we were nearing the center of town, a well-dressed civilian waved to us frantically from an empty streetcar stop. The street cars were not running, everybody had to walk. Everybody but me. I had a private automobile and a chauffeur. It was a pleasing thought.

I told the chauffeur to stop. The man ran up to us excitedly.

"Whose car is this?" he asked with a ring of authority in his voice. I resented that from a civilian.

"Mine," I told him curtly.

"Where did you get it?" he asked sharply.

"I commandeered it."

"I think this is the car that was assigned to me by the National Council," he said excitedly. "It was supposed to have picked me up at six o'clock this morning. I have been waiting till past seven and it did not show up. I am the new Undersecretary of the Food Ministry. I was appointed last night by the National Council. In the name of the National Council I now commandeer this car!" He said that last one in a loud and official voice. It sounded like an order.

He was old enough to be a colonel. I was apprehensive, but I did not want to give up the car. Besides, he was only a civilian.

"Let's go," I said to the chauffeur. He put the car into gear.

"Wait, please, wait!" pleaded the civilian, the tone of authority now gone from his voice. "At least, please, take me to the Food Ministry. I am very late and it would take me at least an hour on foot."

I hesitated.

"If you take me there I'll see that you get a piece of imported Swiss milk chocolate, a full pound each."

"Get in," I told him.

On the way he explained to me what the Food Ministry was. The Food Ministry was in charge of rationing all food in the country. It also had a huge warehouse full of imported foodstuff which was heavily guarded. The Commander of the Guard, a lieutenant, had disappeared two nights before and had not come back. He proposed that I take over command of the Guard and assign the chauffeur and car to the Food Ministry.

That sounded all right to me and I turned to the chauffeur inquiringly. He had one question to ask.

"Is there a kitchen for the personnel?"

The civilian laughed.

"The best in the country. Food you never even heard of in all your life. Imported food and delicacies."

It was all settled. The Food Ministry was housed in an enormous building surrounded by a thick brick wall and it had a massive iron gate. Two indifferent looking guards with rifles carelessly hung on their shoulders were at the gate when we rolled up. We tooted the horn but the guards made no attempt to open the gate. The civilian got out of the car and walked over to them.

"I am Doctor . . . (I can't recall his name for I always called him Doctor; he was not a medical doctor but a Doctor of Philosophy), the new Undersecretary of the Food Ministry," he said impressively. "Open the gate."

The guards just stood. One of them finally said:

"Nobody allowed inside without a pass. Those are the orders."

I got out with my carbine in my hand.

"I am the new Commander of the Guard. Open that gate!"

They opened the gate but did not salute me. I decided not to notice that. We drove inside. The Doctor and I went upstairs, the chauffeur stayed in the courtyard with the car.

The Doctor went into a big office and I followed him. The men there greeted the Doctor with deference. He took one of them aside and they went into a private office. Soon the man came out, introduced himself, and then led me to the Guard's quarters. The Commander's room was of fair size, it was furnished with a desk, two chairs, and an iron cot with a spring and mattress on it. I liked it. We then went to see the sergeant.

The sergeant was a fat, jovial man in his late forties, a grandfatherly looking person. He looked me over, neither friendly nor wary, evidently not ready to make up his mind about me. The civilian then left us.

I asked the sergeant for a report. There were 24 men in the guard detail, 25 including the sergeant. Two men on duty at each of the two gates, one man each at the two main doors inside leading to the warehouses. It was an easy detail. The food was good and plentiful, the men were satisfied, but they would have liked an eight hour change-off.

"Most of us re older men, we don't take too much to soldiering," he concluded.

I was satisfied with the report and told him that I had no intention of changing anything, wanted him to run the outfit as before, but that I would work out a change in schedule so everybody would have eight hours off. I sat right down and worked it out. The sergeant liked it and we were friends, perhaps a bit more friendly than military regulations allowed but it seemed all right to me. I was getting used to treating military regulations as less than sacred. Besides, I had no superiors to take me to task.

That night we drove the Doctor home and promised to call for him at eight in the morning. Then we drove out to Kobanya, picked up my gear, and moved it into my new quarters in the Food Ministry.

Days passed and I was getting very bored. The sergeant ran the Guard and I had nothing to do. The most fateful events in the thousand year history of Hungary were then taking place just outside of the gates but I had little awareness of them because I lacked interest in politics. The newspapers were full of political news and changes but I hardly glanced at the headlines; I was more interested in the features. I simply noted the headlines announcing the end of hostilities and demobilization, without giving them any thought.

Nor did the frenetic enthusiasm with which the newspapers greeted the sensational announcement by the newly appointed Defense Minister, General Landry, "I do not want to see any soldiers any more!" create any impression on me. I did not realize that with that single statement he had dismissed the entire army! I was still a soldier.

One morning the sergeant reported that some of the men wanted to go home and asked me to meet with them. I consented. I had the sergeant parade the guard, then made my first public speech. It was short.

"Men," I said, "the sergeant tells me some of you want to go home. The war is over, the army is disbanded, so I read in the newspapers. I see no reason why any man who wants to go home can't do so. Just report it to the sergeant. Dismissed!"

But the men would not dismiss. They all crowded around me. The sergeant was one of those who wanted to go home. Others asked me whether they had to go home. These came from those far parts of Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Rumania, where the nationalities were reportedly in revolt, committing atrocities against Hungarians. I told them they could stay on as long as they pleased and they felt relieved. All told, fourteen of them decided to go home, which left me with ten. I gave the departing men permission to take all the rations they could carry and they left with bulging packs. Then I cut the guard down to one man at each gate, abolished the rest of the posts, and that was all there was to it.

The next forenoon I was strolling the main corridor, bored, and debating whether to leave for home myself when the Doctor, whose door was open, noticed me and called me in. We were quite friendly by then. There was another man with him whom he introduced as a medical doctor, the owner of a private sanatorium at Lake Balaton, the largest lake in Hungary and a famous summer resort. That doctor had come to Budapest to seek military assistance.

As he explained it to me, the peasants were rising in the neighboring villages. Several large summer homes and estates of the wealthy had been pillaged and set on fire afterward. Peasants friendly to him had informed him that his sanatorium was also on the list. That sanatorium had been used during the war as a convalescent home for officers and was filled with good linen, silver, and expensive therapeutic equipment, all of which were his personal property. Since his sanatorium had catered only to field grade officers, the peasants entertained a particular hatred for it. He almost cried as he related it.

He needed guards for protection. He had appealed to the Defense Ministry but they had no troops at their disposal, they were barely able to mount a guard of their own. In desperation he came to see his old friend in the Food Ministry to see if the latter could help him.

I told them I had only ten guards left myself. This news left them disconsolate. I was outraged and would have liked to teach those peasants a lesson they would not easily forget. I was also bored. I had an idea.

"If you can get me arms I'll get a guard together and go down with you," I told him.

The doctor looked at me with a sour face. He informed me that he had received an authorization to draw arms but he couldn't induce any soldiers to go although he had been at two army barracks.

"Will you pay them the new army pay?" I asked. The new government, realizing that it had acted too hastily in disbanding the army, had tried to rectify its mistake by publishing a new high rate of pay with which to induce soldiers to stay in service. The new schedule was a uniform 10 kronen a day for enlisted men, 30 kronen for officers.

The doctor's face became more sour. He hesitated, then said he would pay it if he had to; he acted rather bitter about it. I did not take to the man but I would not let that bother me.

"Come with me," I told him and led him to the barracks nearest to us. The doctor, a flabby, jaundiced man, protested that he had been there that morning, but I kept walking ahead and he had to follow. When we reached the barracks I told him to wait for me inside the gate and left him.

The first two barrack rooms I entered were not promising. The soldiers, lying on dirty strawsacks on the floor which served as bedding, did not look good to me. In the third room I found a number of younger men, including a sergeant, a husky fellow in his thirties. He looked tough and a leader. He was sitting on his strawsack talking with three other men. I walked over to them.

"Sergeant, I need a guard." He looked at me without replying. The others also kept silent.

"I am recruiting twelve men to guard a sanatorium on Lake Balaton. The pay is ten kronen a day. The food is good and there is a bed for each man to sleep in. We will only mount guard at night. Who of you wants to come?"

This got them on their feet.

"Will there be any nurses there?" one man asked.

"There sure will be servant maids, you dumb ox," said another, which set everybody grinning. That aspect of the mission had eluded me.

Instantly dozens of men were milling around me, asking questions. All were eager to come but I needed only twelve. I called the sergeant aside and asked him to help me pick out twelve good ones, fighters, for we might have to battle looters, and informed him that he would be second in command. He saluted, the first salute I had received since we marched out of Kobanya.

The sergeant lined the men up. By that time there were about thirty of them, and still others were coming from the other barrack rooms attracted by the news. We picked out twelve and they all looked strong and tough. Among them were the trio who were with the sergeant when I first addressed them. The selection raised a minor uproar. The rest clamored to be included, arguing they had as much right to go as the ones I had picked.

"Clear the room!" the sergeant ordered and he charged into the crowd, the other eleven after him. I stepped aside. I was not supposed to mix in a brawl. After a brief scramble the room was cleared. The sergeant lined the men up and said:

"Sir, we're ready to move. Sir, how are we going to get arms?"

I told them that had been arranged and led them out to the doctor. At sight of them the doctor recoiled. They really looked tough, they were much older than I, thirty or over. We walked over to the armory which was guarded by a strong sentry of armed city police. The doctor showed them his authorization and they called the Officer of the Guard. He was a police lieutenant and he read the document over carefully, asked the doctor for his credentials, then ordered the door unlocked and told my men to line up single file outside. He then called me aside and asked me what I needed. I told him I needed enough small arms and ammunition to hold off an entire village if necessary. He listened to the story I outlined and then asked me rather gently:

"Son, do you think you can handle them?"

I felt certain I could. I doubted the peasants would dare start anything while we were around. The police lieutenant shook his head; he did not mean the peasants, he meant my men. A couple of those men, particularly the sergeant, looked like real bad eggs to his practiced eyes. I agreed the men looked tough, but they were all right; the sergeant was eager to take orders from me.

He shook his head and asked, did it occur to me why it was necessary to assign the police to guard the arsenal with all those soldiers available? Precisely to prevent characters like that sergeant from getting hold of arms and turning loose on the civilian population. "Keep your distance, son," he advised me. He went over to the armorer and told him to let us have what we wanted, and then left.

My men fell to it. By the time they were finished they were armed to the teeth. In addition to rifle and bayonet, they each took an attack dagger, a steel helmet, a couple of potato mashers (hand grenades with handles attached), and all the ammunition they could carry in their musette bags. I took a dagger, a pistol with a holster to be worn over the shoulder, two egg grenades. Then I reconsidered and put them all back except the pistol and holster. Next the men spied a stack of brand-new uniforms in a corner and went for them.

"You are not supposed to take uniforms," shouted the armorer. He was a sergeant major, a lifelong professional, the highest ranking noncommissioned officer in the Hungarian Army. He barred their way.

"Don't argue with me," said the sergeant and rammed his shoulder into him, pushing him aside. The armorer fell silent.

After the men were outfitted, we filed out and I lined them up for inspection. The doctor's eyes bulged. I felt proud and powerful as we marched through the courtyard in parade step. Soldiers came running out of the barrack rooms and watched. I wished I had picked a bugler also but by then it was too late.

We marched over to the Southern Depot. It was not too far. The station and platforms were packed with people, the ticket window surrounded by a howling, pushing mob. We did not bother to stop for tickets and headed straight for the train.

The platform in front of the third class carriages was bedlam. Women with large bundles, men loaded down with suitcases, parcels, boxes, children with smaller bundles, were all trying to get on the train at once, with the steps hopelessly jammed; a number of hardy souls were making themselves comfortable on the roofs of the coaches. Everybody was toting something that was invariably too heavy for him. I was thinking of a way to board that train with my men but it seemed hopeless. Then the sergeant at my elbow spoke up:

"Shall we clear one of the coaches, sir?"

That was one solution that had not occurred to me. I reviewed the problem. It did not seem difficult. We could cut through that mob on the platform, pull the people off the steps, yank them out of their seats, throw their bundles after them, finish! The operation would take only minutes.

I was about to assent when my eyes fell on a peasant woman who was sobbing loudly. She was sitting on a large bundle with three badly frightened children around her, surrounded by the swirling mob. The children were also crying, tears and mucus blending on their faces. "Please, in the name of the Lord, someone help me on the train," she wailed. "My husband is sick and we must get back home." There was a helpless desperation in that wail, as of hope abandoned. "It would be people like her whom we would be pitching off the train," the truth dawned on me, and I knew it would be unjust.

"Hold it," I said to the sergeant, "I have another idea. I'll be right back. In the meantime, put that woman and her children on the train if you can." I watched the sergeant talk to his men and in no time they pushed their way to a window. They boosted one of the men through the window into the coach and the others handed the children up to him one by one, then two of them picked up the woman and were squeezing her through the window when I left them. It was a smooth job. Those were capable men.

I made my way to the front of the train. The three second-class carriages there were similarly thronged. There was only one first-class carriage; it looked full, but not jammed. The steps were clear and I saw only a few people at the windows. That meant there was room in the corridor.

Enlisted men and noncoms belonged in the third class. Cadets and junior officers went second class. Only field-grade officers traveled first class. Those were the rules. I was mulling that over in my mind when I saw our doctor enter the first-class carriage. That decided me. I went back to the men.

"Come on. We'll travel first class."

They looked at me and grinned. The sergeant regarded me with approval. I must have passed some test with him.

We boarded the first-class carriage and the men settled themselves in the vestibule. It did not go off without a commotion, other passengers had to move out of their way. The doors of the various compartments opened, well-dressed civilians, men and women, looked out and hurriedly pulled the doors shut behind them. My men behaved in an unusually subdued way. This was the first time they had ever set foot in a first-class carriage. The same held true for me.

I opened the door of one of the compartments in search of a seat for myself. A colonel was sitting at the window. He went into a tantrum when he saw me coming in. I gave him a stiff salute but he ignored it.

"This is an outrage," he attacked me in a shrill, nearly falsetto voice. "How do you dare enter first class! Get off this car at once and get those men off too."

My knees were quaking. There had to be a way out. I recalled the night I led an M.P. patrol for the first time and blandly demanded that all officers, even those I knew, identify themselves. It was a good joke even though I was reprimanded for it later.

"Who are you? What's your name?" screamed the colonel.

I reached out my hand. "Your identification, sir, please!" My voice came out even more falsetto than his.

"What's this? Where are you from?" he spluttered, his voice considerably down. My men, attracted by the scene, were now crowding around the door.

"National Security, Special Guard Duty Detachment, sir!" My voice was now back to normal except for a small quaver in my throat.

"Never heard of that. Let me see your credentials." But there was no command left in his voice any more. It was a request, not an order. I had no more to fear from him.

"Sorry, sir! Your identification, please!" He handed it over and I read it over carefully. This was my first chance to see the credentials of a high-ranking officer, and I was curious. I even read the print in the back. It took time. The colonel began to look apprehensive. I handed it back to him.

"Everything in order, sir. Thank you, sir." I saluted him. He looked greatly relieved and this time he saluted back, rather friendly. I went out and decided to stay in the corridor. I did not want to take any further chances.

We ran into trouble only once more, with the conductor. He insisted we move into a third-class carriage. I settled it by making out a voucher in his book for first-class fare for thirteen military personnel and signed it:

"National Security, Special Guard Duty Detachment." I began to like that name. It sounded impressive even to me. It satisfied the conductor also, only he wanted it stamped.

"Our stamps are being made now. We are a new service," I quieted him. The men watched my transaction with the conductor with great satisfaction. I was definitely beginning to rate with them.

I was learning again, but I did not know it then. I learned that in a time of confusion it is sufficient merely to assume authority to have it respected. That lesson served me well later in Spain.
