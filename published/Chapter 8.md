The days passed quietly and so did the nights. Although rumors reached us that this castle or that estate in outlying villages had been looted or set aflame, we were not molested. The men enjoyed themselves, they had a real vacation for the first time in their lives. They had food, women, and very little work to do. For companionship they had each other and the maids. I had neither and I was getting bored, not being accustomed to idleness. In that entire sanatorium there was not a single book to read. Field-grade officers in the Austro-Hungarian Army had no need for a library. They knew everything, for rank was knowledge. I asked the doctor for some of his medical books to read but he would not lend them to me for fear they would get soiled. I would walk out to the frozen lake shore and hunt for wild ducks with a rifle. I knew I wouldn't hit any, yet every time I missed I felt disappointed.

The doctor annoyed me with his daily complaints.

"The men cut up a brand-new sheet for foot covering," he accused me. Soldiers of the Hungarian Army were not supplied with socks. They would use rags to wrap around their feet before putting on their boots.

'It won't happen again," I solemnly assured him, more on hope than knowledge.

"The men are interfering with the work of the maids," he would complain.

"I'll put a stop to that," I would reply, knowing full well I had no intention of interfering. I wouldn't have gotten anywhere with it anyway.

"The men are forcing their attentions on my maids against their will," he came storming to me one time. "I will hold you responsible for their behavior."

I promised to investigate that complaint at once and went into the kitchen.  I saw four women working there and I called one of them out. She was a buxom, very pretty young woman with rosy cheeks, about twenty-two, I guessed. She was a bit embarrassed and was twirling her apron.

"Are my men molesting you?" I asked her. She blushed and said nothing. "The doctor is telling me our men are forcing themselves on you." She still didn't answer.

"Come on, don't be afraid. Tell me the truth. If they are bothering you women, I'll put a stop to it quick."

"They are sure no worse than those old officers we used to have around here," she said spiritedly. "Those old goats were really terrible. They were practically ordering us to go to bed with them. And when they pinched it really hurt." She giggled.

"What about my men?"

"Oh, they are sociable. They don't pinch so hard."

I wanted to get to the bottom of it. "What do they do?" I asked her.

She giggled some more. I pressed her for an answer.

"Aw, go on with you!" she said, raising her eyes coquettishly to mine."You know what men do. Why don't you try it sometime? Or maybe you are too young."

I wasn't too young and I would have liked to try. I thought of it often enough. But I had to set an example, and you have to pay a price for that. Nevertheless, I felt myself blushing. I blushed too damn easily, just like a young boy.

"Are the men forcing you to do things against your own free will?" My voice was playing tricks on me again. I had been having trouble with it lately. I had a good voice for dealing with men but with women it sometimes came out wrong just when I most wanted it to sound firm. I hoped she did not notice, although she was giggling again.

"Aw, go on with you," she said. "They are men and we are having fun. It is nice to have your own kind around after all those high and mighty officers. You are a nice young one, why don't you come down to the kitchen one evening and find out for yourself?" She was laughing at me openly, all her former diffidence gone.

"That will do," I said gruffly and dismissed her. It did not come out gruff, it sounded more like a squeak. She laughed and went inside. I decided against questioning the other three women and walked back. I had to take it slowly and hold my saber at the grip to keep it from getting between my legs from behind, although the normal way to avoid that is by making a kicklike circular motion with your right leg before you put your foot down.

The next day I told the doctor I had found no evidence that the men were forcing themselves on the maids. The doctor scoffed. He claimed to have it on good evidence, several of the nurses had reported t. I decided to visit the nurses after supper. I had known them all by sight but had had no personal contact with them up until then.

I shaved carefully that evening, the second time that day, although there was no necessity for it. I could easily have skipped my daily morning shave as well without anyone noticing it much. I was blondish, and besides being very light in color the hair on my face grew at a distressingly slow rate, considering my age. I had been shaving daily because that was supposed to make the beard grow thicker and faster, although I had not found that true in my case.

The nurses were six in number and occupied three rooms in a separate wing, one of the rooms being used as a sitting room. I knocked on their door, entered, bowed formally, wished them good evening, and addressed them in my most official manner.

"Ladies, I am here on official duty. I came here to investigate." Suddenly I did not know how to continue, their stares disconcerted me. It was hard to put it into the right words. I started all over again.

"I came to investigate the . . ." I still couldn't get any further. That was most unfortunate for they started to smile and this disconcerted me even more. A little red-haired nurse, the youngest of them, was giggling out loud. She did not look much older than I. The others were all much older. The head nurse, a thin woman with a wrinkled face, turned to them disapprovingly.

"Leave the boy alone. He is only a child. What is it you want, young man?"

I was blushing, which made me mad. I was grateful to her and yet angry at her. I was not a boy and certainly was no child. I would show them that I could use strong language if that is the way they wanted it.

"About my men fornicating with the maids," I said in manly fashion.

They burst out laughing.

"Raping them!" I added for emphasis. Now they were really laughing. One of them exclaimed:

"That would be a new experience to those sluts." That set them laughing even louder, the little redhead the loudest of them all. It is easy to say "investigate" but in practice it can be quite difficult.

"I am going to prepare an official report on it and submit it to the higher authorities." This was according to regulations and it went much smoother. "If you have any evidence, you can inform me here, or if that would embarrass you, I am ready to see each of you alone in my room, in private." I should not have added that last because it set them laughing again.

"What evidence would we have?" asked one of the nurses finally.

"Eyewitness evidence. The doctor said several of you reported it to him."

"Oh, the doctor. Don't pay any attention to him. He is mean. Sit down and visit with us. Here, have some candy." They were all speaking at once and they were very friendly. I sat down and we had a most enjoyable time. They were teasing me about my youth, about my presumed innocence and lack of experience. "I would like to show you, especially this redhead," I told them, and now she blushed. I was thinking how to isolate her and take her for a walk but there was no chance. Those nurses presented a solid female phalanx. When I left we were good friends and they invited me to visit them again.

The next morning I told the doctor the nurses had no evidence. He gave me another one of his sour looks. He had a bigger complaint now. My men had killed one of his pigs, the largest and fattest one.

I went to investigate that. I found it was pure accident. One of the men had accidentally discharged his rifle and it hit that pig. That pig screamed so loud that it had to be killed to put it out of its misery. There were plenty of witnesses, including the entire kitchen help.

I gave the doctor a full report on the case but it did not satisfy him. He said somebody would have to pay him for that pig but I disregarded that remark. That night we had fresh pork for supper and it was a welcome change in our diet.

The next day two fat geese were killed. Again it was an accident, brought about by a most complicated chain of circumstances. We ate the geese.

Next there were towels missing from the laundry. The doctor wanted me to search the men's packs. I told him I had no reason to suspect my men. The doctor kept insisting on the search. I informed him I was planning to have an inspection soon and then we should see.

"How soon?" the doctor wanted to know.

"Thursday," I told him.

"Today is Thursday," said the doctor. I had lost track of the calendar.

"Next Thursday," I said coolly.  The more contact I had with the man, the less I liked him. He disliked us even more. I was wondering how all this would end when suddenly I heard my name called. Two men came running after me. I was wanted in the office, urgent! Emergency!

I ran to the office. I found two civilians with the doctor and they rose when I entered. One was a portly, older man, with a handle-bar mustache, dressed in black with a heavy golden chain across his vest, the President of the Town Council of Siofok. The other was the Town Clerk of Siofok, in Hungary the highest executive official after the Mayor. He was around forty with a blond English mustache, his hair parted in the middle. His clothes looked very elegant and expensive for the Town Clerk of a small town. He was very pale and very excited. He did most of the talking while the other one just sat, pulling and twirling his thick mustache and nodding in assent.

They needed help at once, desperately. Siofok, only twelve miles away, was in revolt!
