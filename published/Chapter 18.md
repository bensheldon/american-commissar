By the middle of 1928 I finished my third play. Shubert had taken a five-year option on my first one: with two other plays now going the rounds, a Broadway production did not seem too far off.

Next I turned experimentally to the short story and wrote two. <em>Vanity Fair</em> bought them both and invited me to submit more.

I was awed when I saw my name appear in <em>Vanity Fair</em> along with such famous writers as Aldous Huxley, Sherwood Anderson, D. H. Lawrence, Ferenc Molnár, and even G. K. Chesterton, not to mention Alexander Woollcott and Deems Taylor. Shopworker or not, I was sure beginning to travel in illustrious company.

There was but one fly in the ointment. I was disappointed in my writing. As a great admirer of Bernard Shaw and Galsworthy, I wanted to write about social problems instead of turning out amusing froth. Now I decided to chance it even though I felt I was treading on unsure ground.

For plot in my new play I drew on my experiences in the Hungarian Revolution. The hero was to be a naive young man suddenly confronted with the problem of whether to uphold law and order which meant protecting the corrupt township officials, or to side with the victims which meant giving in to mob rule.

The play was shaping up well, the characters were coming through sharp and clear, the situation showed rich dramatic promise, when suddenly my foundation began to totter. In trying to delineate the conflicting views of the opposing characters, questions arose in my mind that led to other questions, more and more fundamental ones, such as:

<p style="padding-left:30px;">What was law and what was order?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Since those town officials were undeniably guilty of misusing their governmental powers and of cheating those defenseless war widows and orphans out of their allotments, was it still morally justifiable to shield them from mob justice? Is mob justice really justice or vengeance?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Where does justice end and vengeance begin?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">In any case was it justice, was it morally justifiable to strip those wretched, freezing peasants of their looted army blankets and clothes when, after all, those were government property?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">To whom does government property belong?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Was the Károlyi revolutionary government a legitimate government?</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">When it comes right down to it, what makes a government legitimate?</p>

Those questions kept breeding like rabbits until I found myself way beyond my depth. I tried to read up on the subject but each source seemed to contradict the others. I felt stymied and when a girl invited me to go with her to visit Norman Thomas, head of the American Socialist Party, I jumped at the chance.

Norman Thomas lived near the Village. His paneled and book-filled study reminded me of a sacristy. I didn't know then that he had actually been a minister. He was tall, handsome, gracious, and cultured, but I found myself tongue-tied and although he invited us to visit him again, I never did. He didn't fit in my play.

That mob leader who challenged the hero in my play was a wild peasant agitator with blood in his eye and Norman Thomas just didn't fit that part. I couldn't imagine him using the words a rabble-rouser was supposed to say.

I fretted and fussed, putting my own speeches into the mouth of that mob leader, but they sounded unconvincing. How the hell did I know what those damned peasants really thought or wanted besides looting and stringing up those town officials? Then I recalled the <em>Uj Elore</em>, a Hungarian daily published in New York. I had read a few copies of it when I was a new immigrant but it was too radical to interest me. I went out and bought a copy. It was even more radical now; it had gone completely Communist. Those people ought to know all about it if I could only gain entry to them. Then I bethought myself of Emery Balint, a Hungarian writer whose novel I was once asked to translate into English. I knew he was part of that <em>Uj Elor</em>e crowd, he ought to be able to help me.

I called Balint, outlined my problem, told him I would like him to help me meet some Hungarian radicals so I could acquaint myself with their lingo. Balint was most co-operative and said he would do even better—he would arrange for me to meet some of the men who actually took part in the Hungarian Revolution. As a start he invited me to a public meeting of the Anti-Horthy League scheduled for the following week.

I thanked Balint for his assistance. This was indeed a lucky break. I considered radicals and Communists secretive, clannish people and had never expected that a simple telephone call would get me near them.

That telephone call proved even more potent, could I have divined it. It started me on a journey that made a professional revolutionary out of me and led inevitably to Spain.
