When we got near Siofok, I told the drivers to take us to the rear of the Town Hall and stop a block away. It was close to seven by then and it was dark. We weren't hungry. The men had scrounged enough bread, hard sausage, smoked Hungarian bacon from the help in the Doctor's kitchen to have our fill on the way over. When we got to within fifty yards of the rear of the Town Hall, we got off, brushed the straw off our uniforms and I had the sergeant line the men up. The street was dark. There seemed to be some light in the square in front of Town Hall and a murmur was rising from that direction.

My plan was to show maximum strength, I explained to the men. We were to march into the square in a double file, but stretched out in length to give us a column twenty yards long. We were to enter in parade step, rifles at ready, bayonets fixed, then deploy into a long skirmish line in front of Town Hall. By the time we had that all straightened out a small crowd had collected, gaping at us in silence, and more people were hurrying toward us. It was time. I drew my saber and commanded in loud parade drill voice:

"Attention! Fix bayonets! Rifles at ready!"

The movements were executed with precision. The daily drills did prove effective.

"Forward, march!"

The cobblestones resounded under the parade steps. We rounded the Town Hall and marched on to the square, the people scampering out of our way to clear space for us. We deployed in front of the Town Hall. The line looked imposing. It reached almost from one corner of the building to the other.

I faced the crowd, mainly women and old men with a sprinkling of soldiers in faded worn uniforms. Our uniforms were new.

I raised my saber, stood at attention, and called out:

"In the name of the law I order you to clear this square at once and disperse to your homes." It was from the manual, except I left "the King" out before "law."

Nobody moved. There was silence.

Suddenly someone shouted:

"Tin Soldiers. Go home! Nobody wants you here." That raised a few other shouts but not so loud and distinguishable.

"Who said that?" I challenged.

A huge man in a torn army blouse stepped forward. There was a loud murmur of approval from the crowd.

"Tell them, Steve," a voice encouraged him.

He walked forward and faced me.

"What if I said it?" he challenged in a loud truculent voice.

"You are under arrest," I snapped.

"On whose orders?" he jeered.

I motioned to the sergeant. He stepped forward, raised his rifle and brought the steel butt down full force on the soldier's head. The man collapsed. Women screamed. The crowd edged back.

"Anyone else care to say anything?" My voice sounded very shrill.

Nobody did. A couple of women started crying.

"I give you one minute to disperse or we'll fire," I warned, my voice pitched very high in excitement. The crowd broke and hurried off, the last ones breaking into a run.

Only then did I take a look at the man on the ground. He was gasping for breath with a snoring sound and blood was running down his face. I was suddenly struck with remorse. That man might die! Everything on the square had come off as I had anticipated, but it had not occurred to me that someone might be killed. The Town Clerk and other civilians now came running out of the Town Hall, all excited, all of them talking to me at once. I did not hear what they were saying, I couldn't tear my eyes off that bleeding man. Finally I told them:

"Get a doctor! That man is hurt! Take him inside and bandage him!"

He was carried inside and I followed him in. They put him in a cell and somebody started to bandage his head. Everybody was crowding around and you couldn't move in that small cell. I sent a civilian to tell the sergeant to send me a guard, told everybody to clear out, instructing the guard to stay with the man in the cell. I left with the civilians who took me to the Council Room.

The Council Room was in a hubbub. I was escorted to a seat next to the Council President and we all sat down. There must have been nearly twenty civilians around the table, all older men, older than my father. They looked rich, they wore thick golden watch chains, heavy rings, dark heavy clothes of expensive material. A big coal stove was burning in the center.

It did not look at all like what I had imagined a council meeting would be. The Councilmen appeared overexcited, talking in overloud tones, practically shouting. They acted scared. Finally the Town Clerk quieted them and made a short speech. He said that for the time being things were safe and described how we had dispersed the mob. When he mentioned me they all clapped their hands and shouted "bravo," which embarrassed me. The Town Clerk then said that they were there to decide what to do next, how to keep the mob in its place, and asked for proposals.

A number of them spoke at once. A big red-faced man kept yelling, "We have to teach them a lesson, a lesson they'll never forget, by God!" They all agreed with that and then one of them asked, "What kind of a lesson? And how?"

The red-faced man, he owned a large livestock farm just outside of Siofok I was told, had the answer.

"We got a prisoner, the leader of the mob. Let's take and hang him. That will teach them the lesson they need, teach them to stay away from people's property and steal their pigs and livestock."

A few people shouted their assent. The others suddenly turned very quiet. That was an altogether new idea. I felt scary.

The Town Clerk then turned to me and asked me directly what my idea was on the subject. The question caught me unawares, I never had thought I had anything to do with that.

They were all staring at me waiting for my answer. I pictured the man lying on the ground with blood all over his face, his breathing so strained, and I became still more scared. I had not meant for the sergeant to club him over the head with a rifle butt. All I had intended was to put him under arrest so that the rest of the crowd would then disperse, and now they wanted to hang him.

The silence was stretching.

"What do you propose to do, Commander?" the Town Clerk prompted me again.

"Military guards can't hang people," I finally managed to bring out. "They can only fire at mobs when they don't obey commands, or offer resistance." I went on to explain the military rules relating to mobs and domestic disorders. As I spoke, my confidence returned. I was citing the manual which I knew by heart and the words came out fluently, allowing me to think ahead while I spoke. They listened intently.

I explained that in order to make those people respect authority we had to demonstrate to them they had to obey and couldn't get away with breaking the law. I proposed that next morning we make a house-to-house search and confiscate all military property looted from the depot. They cheered that. I also proposed that we patrol the streets once in the morning, once in the afternoon, and twice in the evening from dark until ten o'clock. By then most people would be in bed.

They liked all but the last part. They wanted to have the patrol out all night.

That was not practical. I told them I couldn't divide my men. A two-man patrol wouldn't look too formidable. The guard had to stay together because as a unit, even if they were not out on the street, they constituted a strong armed force which was more than the mob could expect to cope with, and the mob would be aware of that. Besides, the men had to have their sleep and rest.

They heard me out but they still insisted on an all-night patrol. That gave me an idea.

"Let's organize a civilian patrol out of you men and I will assign two of my men to lead you. Then the guard will still be kept together as a strong reserve."

They finally agreed. I asked the Town Clerk to call together next afternoon all those who would want to serve on the patrol, bringing whatever weapons were available in town—shotguns, pistols, etc.—and we would organize them.

They assigned a large room right in Town Hall as quarters for my men and agreed to supply them mattresses and three free meals daily, while I was to be the guest of the town and provided with a luxury room and everything else I desired, gratis, in the best hotel in town. By the time the meeting adjourned everybody was cheerful. They came up to me, shook my hands, clapped me on the back just as if I were one of them. I did not feel that way. I was not fully at ease with them.

I went outside and told the men about the arrangements. They liked it. We went to the designated hotel and the men all had a fine meal, each ordering whatever he wanted. They were even served a <em>spriccer</em> each, wine with soda. Afterwards they got their mattresses, toted them over to the Town Hall, and settled down.

I told the sergeant to take the patrol through the town later that night and to make plenty of noise so the people would know the town was being patrolled. Since it was late in November and very cold, I decided not to station a guard outside the Town Hall, but to post one inside the door, relieved every two hours. That was most satisfactory with the men and it was a sound arrangement, for there was no danger of attack.

Next I went to see the prisoner. His head had been bandaged and the blood washed off his face but he was still unconscious and breathing very hard. It made me feel uneasy; I was scared that he would die.

My assigned hotel was close by. A couple of the Councilmen were in the restaurant and they invited me over. I did not feel like eating and they treated me to drinks. I soon felt woozy. I excused myself, went to my room, undressed, and went to bed.

I couldn't have been asleep long when a persistent knock at my door woke me. I grabbed my pistol and opened the door. It was the hotel porter with a weeping peasant woman dressed in black, a woolen shawl over her head and shoulders.

"She insisted on seeing you, sir, and she wouldn't stay away," the porter explained apologetically. "I kept chasing her but she would keep coming back and crying so loud I was afraid she would wake the whole street. I thought it would be better for you to talk to her, sir."

The woman, who stood there sniffling during the porter's speech, now burst into a loud wail.

"What's going to happen to my husband? They told me he was dying. What's going to become of our poor orphans?" She was the wife of the prisoner. I felt very guilty. I got dressed in a hurry, told the woman to come with me, and led her to Town Hall. It took a lot of knocking before the guard opened the door. He was groggy with sleep.

"I must have closed my eyes for a second," he apologized sheepishly. I took the woman to the cell with me.

The man was still lying unconscious, his eyes half open but not seeing, his breath whistling through his parted lips.

The woman let out a scream and threw herself on her husband, wailing "Stevie, oh Stevie, what did they do to you?" She wasn't directly referring to me, but the accusation struck home. I told the woman she could stay there with him as long as she wished. She paid no attention to me. She squatted down on the floor and gently lifted his injured head into her lap. I left them, walked back to the hotel, and went back to bed.

The next morning I divided my men into four details and we made a house-to-house search in the section where the poor lived. We confiscated four cartloads of boots, blankets, underwear, uniforms, packs, and other army material.

The people whose homes we searched were sullen. Many of them offered me bribes to let them keep the stuff, others muttered that we didn't care if they froze to death. I never anticipated that the job would turn out so distasteful. I did not relish confiscating those blankets and clothes, but of course it was looted stuff, it did not belong to them, it was government property.

During the next three mornings we recovered enough army clothing and other property to nearly fill the box car in which I deposited them for eventual shipment to the Szekesfehervar Army Base. The three-man team I personally supervised recovered more looted material than the other three combined. I was proud of that achievement. I attributed it to the keenness of my eyes in spotting army equipment. It did not occur to me that the eyes of the others might have been just as keen or even keener, but more sympathetic to the poor, or that perhaps the other men were not as unresponsive to the offered bribes as I had been. I saw no need to have the freight car guarded, for the situation was well in hand. I had a stout padlock put on it and took the key with me.

The organization of the civilian patrol did not prove difficult. About fifty men volunteered and they had eighteen shotguns and a few pistols among them. I divided them into three groups, the first one to patrol from six to eight in the evening, the second from eight to ten, the third from ten to twelve. They were older men, the most substantial citizens in town.

I assigned my men to lead them. Since there were not enough firearms to go around, some carried heavy canes.

The patrol worked out fine. I checked every patrol before it went out, and we joked quite a bit. They were rather proud of themselves and talked and laughed loud when making their tours, which I liked. There were no disturbances.

One of the Councilmen who was a processor and exporter of Hungarian paprika, took a particular liking to me. He took me home for dinner and introduced me to his daughter. Her name was Yolan but everybody called her Yolly. She was seventeen, a year younger than I, a very pretty girl with dimples in her cheeks, especially when she laughed. She told me she had a deep admiration for me. We fell in love at sight and I came to spend all my free moments in her house, particularly since her mother and father insisted that I make their house my home. Her mother would cook special dishes for me and bake my favorite cakes. Yolly and I got together every time I was free, and we kissed at every opportunity. That was about all we did; Yolly was not talkative, and I, too, preferred that to conversation.

I also had a personal problem. The hotel where I was living had a blond cashier and she would slip into my room at night when she heard me coming home. I had a few bottles of liqueur in my room, a present from the hotel, and I would find her there half drunk. She smelled heavily of perfume and underarm perspiration. She had a big bust and she was full of smutty remarks. She would smooth my hair and make other advances. I did not like her and always had a difficult time sending her back into her own room. Once she even sneaked into my bed after I was asleep, but I did not enjoy it. From that night on she would make eyes at me during meals and ask me when would I be nice to her again. It was most annoying; since she was much older, I had to treat her with courtesy.

Within a few days the situation in the town was fully under control. Most of the trains in the country had stopped running because of the coal shortage and the few that occasionally managed to come through had to use wood for fuel, which made them very slow. Because of that, only a few soldiers had succeeded in making their way back to the town from Italy. I spoke with some and they told me hair-raising tales of how the treacherous Slovenes and Croatians, who were part of Austro-Hungary until the time of their revolt, had mistreated them, their former comrades in arms; how they had robbed them of their clothing, even stealing the boots off their feet when they caught them asleep.

The arrested man survived, and I gave his wife permission to take him home. Instead of showing hate, they both thanked me profusely for my kindness. The wife called innumerable blessings on my head, kissed my hand, and her children kissed the hem of my tunic. It was painfully embarrassing and I felt much relieved when they left.

By the eleventh day life had become routine. Then a bit of trouble developed. Payday in the Hungarian Army was every ten days and the men expected to get paid. The Town Clerk informed them that the Council had decided that the President had lacked authority when he had offered them triple pay instead of the official ten kronen a day. The men demanded full pay as promised. The Town Clerk claimed the treasury was short of money. The men became threatening and for the first time disregarded me when I tried to calm them. I never liked to haggle about money, but I had to take the men's part. Finally they got paid in full, 300 kronen each man, which was a great deal of money at that time, more than most of them had ever seen in one lump sum, and they were very satisfied. Since the treasury was short I told the Clerk I was willing to wait for my 900 kronen. He was greatly pleased and thanked me for my co-operation. I was in no need of money, the hotel even supplied my cigarettes free.

That night I had been long asleep when I was suddenly jarred awake by loud knocking and excited voices outside. I jumped out of bed and opened the door. I found three men there, all Councilmen, and they were trembling with fear. There was a riot at the depot. It was then past eleven o'clock.

"Where is the patrol?" was my first question.

They were the patrol, they quaked.

"Where are your arms?" I asked angrily.

Their arms had not been turned over to them that night. When they assembled to relieve the second patrol, the sergeant had sent them home saying his men would take over the third patrol. They all went home except these three, who decided to have a few drinks first. On their way home they had witnessed the riot at the depot and ran right over to see me.

That meant serious trouble. I threw my clothes on in such a hurry that I even left my saber belt off, just snatched up the holster with the pistol, and rushed toward the depot.

It was quite a distance and I was out of breath by the time I reached the depot. The moon was bright and the platform in front of the freight car was dark with people, most of them women.

The door of the freight car was wide open and two of the sergeant's cronies were busy passing blankets, boots, clothing to the people clamoring below. They had improvised an aisle by placing the massive railroad benches from the waiting room parallel to each other and the people had to pass through this to reach the open door of the freight car.

I saw the sergeant standing on the first bench facing his third crony on the opposite bench. Their hands were full of bills, they were collecting money from the upthrust hands of the clamorous women before permitting them to pass through the aisle. The women were shrieking, pushing and pulling each other—it was a riot all right.

I discovered the rest of my men on the fringe of the crowd. They were not party to that organized looting nor did they do anything to interfere; they were just watching. They caught sight of me at the same time I noticed them.

"Follow me." I motioned to them. As I saw them close up behind me, I drew my pistol and went out to the platform. I was boiling mad.

"Stop it," I commanded. "Halt!"

Every face turned toward me. The two soldiers on the freight car froze. The crowd gave way. It was very still.

I walked over to the sergeant.

"You are under arrest!"

The sergeant grabbed for his rifle and cursed. "Get out of here or I'll kill you."

My finger tightened on the trigger. I was ready to shoot him.

"Attention!" I commanded in a fury. The other three men with him snapped to. The sergeant did not.

There was a fraction of hesitation.

"To foot!" I ordered with my pistol extended straight, aimed at his stomach.

The sergeant executed the command. His rifle butt made a loud bang on the wooden bench as he brought it down to position.

"You four men are under arrest." I was still furious. "Take his rifle," I said to the corporal with me. The drilling paid off. The sergeant turned over his rifle and we marched the four of them back to Town Hall. By then the platform was empty, the crowd had scurried off.

We marched them down to a cell and locked them in. I told the corporal that from then on he was in charge and that I wanted a guard over that cell all through the night. Then I returned to the hotel.

On the way back I felt strangely empty. My mind couldn't concentrate. I went to bed, closed my eyes, but I couldn't sleep. I kept seeing that platform, the women milling around, the sergeant with his rifle pointing at me from less than three yards' distance, ready to kill me. That image swirled round and round and suddenly I started to tremble. I wanted to stop shaking but I couldn't. I felt my whole body go rigid and I bounced up and down uncontrollably, setting the bed vibrating. Then I began to shiver again until I climbed out of bed, which stopped it. Shock has strange effects.
