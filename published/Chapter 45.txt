Almansa was a Spanish town with a population of about 15,000, serving as the training base for the artillery units of the I.B. The American battery to which I had been attached did not possess a single gun, not even for training. It had no instruments, no artillery tables, nothing but its name to signify it as an artillery unit. A tall Minnesota-born Swede going under the name of Anderson, who had received elementary military training while attending the Lenin School in Moscow, was acting as our instructor. He had been taught in Moscow how to handle a 75-mm. Russian gun and he was trying to transmit that learning to the battery, quite a task without a gun or any other material to work with.

I found the men in the battery in a state of demoralization. The battery, named after John Brown the abolitionist for its propaganda value in America, had been organized in April, 1937. When I joined it in the first week of June it had grown to approximately seventy to eighty men, nearly half of them Americans of foreign birth who had had some previous artillery training in the conscript armies of their countries of origin.

The battery had no officers, the acting military leader was Anderson. The unit was too small to rate a commissar—political commissars were not assigned to combat units smaller than a company, and the political "responsible" assigned to that battery was a reddish young man, alternately called Slim or Red; he hailed from somewhere in Maryland, I believe. Anderson was around twenty-nine, Slim around twenty-two. Most people in the battery were older men. About twelve of them were seamen whose uninhibited behavior gave Slim, Anderson, and their prissy clique of YCLers considerable concern.

Most men in the battery were an unhappy lot. They had come to Spain to fight and found themselves cooped up within the walls of a small former school building, spending their time in meaningless small tasks, forced to listen daily to long, boring, repetitious political lectures on Fascism delivered with deadly monotony by Slim, a schoolboy rehash of the propaganda material poured out by the ton by the Communist Party in the shape of leaflets, pamphlets, articles, bulletins, etc., to which the men had the same access as he. The food was devoid of all variety, it was usually <em>garbanzo</em> (dried chick peas) cooked in water together with some mule or burro meat. The <em>garbanzo</em> was hard and the meat was so tough it defied chewing, it was elastic like an old auto tire and snapped back when one tried to take a big bite out of it. It had to be swallowed and left for the digestive juices to do the rest.

The party leadership which consisted of Slim, Anderson, and a solemn, self-important young YCLer from New York called Walsh, were constantly exhorting the men not to frequent the Spanish taverns and to stay away from the bordello; to conduct themselves with dignified austerity as befits Communists. The seamen who liked their vino and their women rebelled against that sanctimonious attitude. This led to constant clashes with the leadership who considered the seamen a blot on the working class.

The greatest sources of irritation to the men were the glowing accounts that appeared in the <em>Daily Worker</em> and other party publications describing the heroic deeds performed daily by the Americans in the International Brigades, and the letters they were receiving from home which were inspired by those articles. Those letters were full of hero-worship, expressing the admiration of their comrades and sweethearts who humbly apologized for staying back home while the subject of their admiration was heroically killing Fascists wholesale, braving mortal peril every minute of the day.

The writers of those letters invariably begged for details about their heroes' personal exploits, chiding them about their modesty, imploring them to let them share in the thrill of combat if only by mail. Some comrades in the battery rose nobly to that call and sent back long gory accounts about dead Fascists piled up like cordwood in front of their battery. Then the recipients of the letters would write back relating proudly how they had read those thrilling accounts of victory aloud in their party units and how the letters had inspired and spurred them on to redouble their efforts in collecting money for Spanish aid; how it had helped them in recruiting new members for the party.

Those letters from home accentuated the frustrations of the men in the battery and made them cynical about party propaganda.

Then one day six of those field guns actually arrived. They were destined for the other two batteries, composed mostly of Czechs and Slovaks that had been formed months before ours, but they let us borrow one gun for the time being.

Having a gun with which to train perked up the morale of the battery considerably, so much so that the exuberant Party leadership of the I.B. in Almansa decided to go a step further and induce the Spaniards in the town to abandon their siestas as an inadmissible waste of productive time. To prove to the Spaniards that it is not injurious to health to work during siesta hours we were ordered to start our afternoon training at one instead of the customary four.

Accordingly we would march singing through the town, with bugles blowing, to set a commendable example, until the alcalde of the town felt compelled to send us an official protest about our noisy marching and loud singing that interfered with the siesta of the populace. He coupled this with the formal request that we abstain from such barbarian practices forthwith.

A second attempt to introduce Soviet methods into Spain met with similar results. The party had declared a </em>subotnik</em> (voluntary work-party on the Soviet model) to help the Spanish People, and the Internationals were ordered to a near-by village on a Sunday to assist the peasants with the harvest.

We arrived at the village about three hundred strong and were met by a delegation of peasants who escorted us to the wheat-field. The wheat was pitifully stunted, the stalks hardly reached the knee and barely yielded more than a few kernel, of grain.
The field was full of rocks, the wheat growing sparsely among the outcropping. I had expected we would be furnished scythes but all they had were blunt sickles of cheap-grade steel that neither had nor could hold any kind of an edge. To cut the wheat we had to bend double, grab hold of three or four—all we could reach at one time—and saw the blade back and forth to sever the tough stalks.

The peasants stood by glumly as they saw us trample down the wheat, leave more stalks than we cut, work for five minutes and rest for ten, make them run endlessly for water. And after about an hour of grunting exertion, they watched us stretch out on the ground to rest. After about three hours of that we halted altogether and began clamoring for food. Finally they had no choice but to take us back to the village and empty their meager larders to provide us with bread, cheese, and a small bit of sausage, all the food they had. We were supposed to return the next week but the peasants wouldn’t have us again—we had eaten them out of ten times the amount of food that the wheat we had harvested was worth. That expedition certainly failed to cement good will between us and the population; if anything, it increased the average Spaniard's distrust of the "<em>extranjeros</em>.”

Two days later Sandor Cseresznyes, a young Hungarian from Transylvania who was with the Czech battery and who claimed to have be a journalist back home, came to call on me. He spoke English and showed me a copy of an article he hadwritten about that <em>subotnik</em> which he had sent to the <em>Daily Worker</em> in New York. He expected to get paid for it and he thought I might advance him some money until he received his check. I laughed at that naïveté, and when I read the copy of his article my eyes opened wide in disbelief. It was a paean to international solidarity, presenting a glowing but wholly imaginary account of the prosperity of the "Spanish village Kolkhozes" which the Spanish peasants, having become the owners of the land formerly belonging to the nobility, were now cultivating with the most modern machinery and farm equipment. It described the mowing of the wheat by huge tractor combines and it ended up with a vivid description of the banquet the villagers had tendered us in gratitude for our help.

Cseresznyes was standing by hopefully as I read on and became completely flabbergasted when instead of praise I told him angrily I was going to write at once to the <em>Daily Worker</em> refuting that article and denouncing it as an out-and-out lie.

"But it's propaganda, real good propaganda!" he wailed, and when I told him that I considered those barefaced lies very bad propaganda and harmful to our cause he vehemently disagreed. The bigger the lie, the better the propaganda, that was the way he understood it.

I do not know whether my letter ever reached the <em>Daily Worker</em> or not. I do know that about a month or six weeks later I saw that article in the <em>Daily Worker</em> and it was given quite a display. It was published under Cseresznyes' by-line and the introduction gave a glowing write-up to Cseresznyes, that fighting young anti-Fascist hero and volunteer. The article was illustrated by a composite photograph showing a huge combine in a lush wheatfield with the close-up of a peasant, who looked more Russian than Spanish, riding a shiny new tractor. The captions explained that those combines were a common sight in the new Spanish co-operatives. (The last time I came across the name of that anti-Fascist hero was during the trial of Vogeler, the American Vice President of the International Telephone Company in Budapest, who was charged with espionage by the Communist government of Hungary. The main witness against Vogeler was this very same Sandor Cseresznyes who had been planted in his cell as an alleged spy himself to gain his confidence and who subsequently gave sworn evidence against Vogeler which the latter denounced as pure fabrication.)

A few days later our solitary gun was taken away from us and reassigned to the Czech battery which was being equipped for the front. It did not look as though our battery would ever get near the front and it was time to make my move if I wanted to see some fighting. Not having heard from Bill Laurence, the American base commissar, I wrote to Joe Dallet who was Commissar of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion then in training in Tarazona, and informed him that I was buried in Almansa, that I wanted to transfer to the infantry and join his battalion.

I received a reply from Joe the next Sunday. He regretted that his table of organization was full and complained about the enormous amount of work and immense responsibility resting on his shoulders. He invited me to visit him the first chance I had. I asked Slim for a leave but it was not granted. I was stewing and simmering by the time Bill Laurence came to visit the battery.

Bill Laurence was a man around forty with thick, almost white, gray hair which he wore parted in the middle. He was the Party's District Organizer in New York and had been sent to Spain after the Lincoln mutiny to give the Americans some standing with the base command of the I.B. He told me that at the request of the General Staff of the Red Army in Moscow the Comintern had decided to form an historical commission in the International Brigades. It was to be a small, confidential commission and knowing that Alpi had asked me to do some work along those lines for the Party hack home, Laurence had recommended me for its Anglo-American section.

My appointment came through a few days later. I was transferred to the Political Section of the International Brigades, the Party apparatus of the Comintern, assigned to the Historical Commission. When I saw my tide, I laughed. I was a <em>Jefe</em>—a Chief. In Spanish it really sounded grandiose. I had been appointed:

<em>Jefe de la Sección Ingles y Americano de la Comisión Histórica de las Brigadas Internacionales.</em>

It was still not combat duty. Yet it was better than being an assistant loader of nonexistent shells to an imaginary field gun in a paper battery in a small sleepy town in a remote corner of Spain.
