The <em>Queen Mary</em> was a new ship, the largest passenger ship then afloat. I traveled with Dr. Julius Hene, a young physician around 28, a recent graduate of a Viennese medical school, who was joining the medical staff of the International Brigades. Our cover story was that we were both going to the coronation in London. Dr. Hene was an intensely serious young man, a native American of German descent. He had become converted to Communism in Austria and had occasionally, by virtue of possessing a genuine American passport, served as a Comintern courier in Europe. He was a sincere idealist and humanitarian—that led him to take up medicine and also to embrace Communism. We were both in a hurry to get to Spain, we had both been made to understand that we were urgently needed. The fact that we were being sent on ahead instead of waiting for a transport of volunteers to assemble emphasized the urgency of our mission.

Going off to war is a profound experience that calls for the mustering of all spiritual resources within a man. When one's nation is at war this ordeal is eased by an overpowering appeal to every man's patriotic duty to protect his country, his family, his traditions and way of life from the enemy. When bugles blow, drums roll, and the adoring population cheers one on, the waver­ ing spirit becomes fortified; one's fears are soothed by the knowledge that whatever sacrifices he may be called upon to render will earn him the gratitude of his nation.

This was not the case with me. I was going off to war surreptitiously. Instead of being cheered on by flags and flowers I had to sneak into Spain. If there was to be any comfort for me I had to find it in the strength of my convictions. It was chilly on deck, the wake of the <em>Queen Mary</em> was barely discernible in the foggy mist. It was high time to take stock. I was going to Spain at the request of the party in the full knowledge that I might never come back. Was my faith in the party, in the Communist movement, really justified?

The realist in me said no. Then what was I doing on this ship?

No, I must not look at this problem individualistically, I must consider it dialectically, from a historical point of view. Let's take a look at the American Communist Party, what was wrong with it?

Plenty. When I first joined, it was a queer, ludicrously ineffectual, small sect. In fact, I was ready to quit when that damn policeman clubbed me. After my anger simmered down I would have quit anyway had not Kovess induced me to take a temporary assignment with the <em>Uj Elore</em>, to learn the real spirit of Communism from the Hungarian revolutionary leaders there. That Hungarian movement sure turned out to be a cesspool of factional rivalry by the most unscrupulous means for leadership.

Working in the general party was more rewarding, although it was soon evident that the general party was just as dominated by personal jealousies and a scramble for higher posts as the Hungarian movement.

The changes that had taken place in the party in the past few years could in no way be condoned. Inner party democracy had been increasingly suppressed by the top leadership. Hypocrisy was creeping into the party, an un-Marxian practice of with­ holding the truth even from the membership. I recalled an inter­view for the <em>Daily Worker</em> I had had with Harold H. Burton (later Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court), shortly after his election as Mayor of Cleveland. Burton had received me courteously and answered all my questions fully and sincerely. He denied the accusation that he was beholden to the Chamber of Commerce. He firmly maintained that he intended to be a mayor representing the interests of the entire population of Cleveland regardless of race, color, or political affiliations; that he respected the constitutional rights of all citizens including Communists. Finally he expressed his willingness to meet with us as with all other groups of citizens to consider our program for the welfare of the people.

That interview was really a scoop, a demonstration of the effectiveness of our new united front policy. It was the first time a high elected official had ever consented to sit down openly with a Communist and afford him the same right and courtesy as to any other citizen. At the end of the interview, Burton politely expressed his opinion that the interview would most likely be distorted in publication and he only smiled at my protestations. I sent that story by wire and a few hours later I received a congratulatory wire from James, managing editor of the <em>Daily Worker</em>, who had quit the New York Times to improve the quality of the <em>Daily Worker</em>. He complimented me that I had done it again, this was the type of story the <em>Daily Worker</em> needed to transform it into a real newspaper giving information to the working class, another example for the others on the staff to emulate.

That telegram had been addressed to party headquarters and delivered to Williamson by mistake. Williamson asked to see a copy of the article, eager to see what Mayor Burton had said to me, particularly since he had ridiculed my assumption that I could persuade Mayor Burton to consent to be interviewed by the <em>Daily Worker</em>.

As he read on, Williamson became more and more agitated and finally exclaimed in consternation:

"The <em>Daily Worker</em> can't print that. It contradicts everything we said about Burton before his election!"

I protested at once. I argued that the interview had opened the door for the party to place our local relief program officially before the mayor. This would certainly react to the benefit of the unemployed.

Williamson was adamant. He claimed that publishing that article would create illusions about Mayor Burton among our membership, would make him appear less reactionary than he was. I told Williamson that Burton's opinions as expressed to me were not reactionary—Burton was definitely a constitutionalist, he was a conservative yet not without some progressive leanings. Labeling Burton an out-and-out reactionary would be contrary to the facts and therefore un-Marxian, it would prevent us from developing the right tactical approach to the Burton administration. It was no use. Williamson called up Browder and the story was killed over my and James's protests. What better example was there of deliberate suppression of the truth, of keeping the membership ignorant of the actual situation?

All right, that certainly was no news to me. I knew that all along. Then why did I ask for a year's leave of absence instead of quitting the party?

Because the ideals of a better society, of a Communist society, far transcended the sorry showing of the American Communist Party. The party itself was sound, the rank and file membership sincere, self-sacrificing. Where else could I expect to find such unselfish comradeship, such satisfying human relationships with which I had been greeted in every town, every hamlet, on my organizational and fund-raising tours for the party? Besides, there was this aspect, the party had brought me maturity. I received as much as I gave. The party had provided me the chance to take an active part in shaping history, to play an active part in organizing the unorganized, to act as one of the unofficial midwives at the birth of the Rubber Workers Industrial Union, to cite just one example.

Granted, the American party was infantile, bureaucratic, even dictatorial. The Hungarian party leaders were dwarfs, the American party leaders midgets.

But I was now going to Spain to fight under the leadership of the Comintern, the giants of the revolution; to fight and die, yes, die if necessary on the side of the legendary Communist leaders who had defied prison, torture, consumed by but one ambition—to free the masses from oppression.

My doubts and anxieties were gone, I felt certain I would resolutely measure up to whatever I might be called upon to face. I was startled to hear a voice addressing me.

"You sure look happy, Voros. I heard you whistling even from the far side of the deck. What are you so cheerful about?"

It was Dr. Hene.

"About going to Spain, Julius!" I told him. "I'm going, too," said Dr. Hene looking at me curiously. "But that's our duty, nothing to whistle about." He was always in­ congruously solemn.

"That's the German in you, Julius. Duty can be a pleasure if you have the right slant."

I did have the right slant. I was "the hard-tempered steel blade of the class struggle, a Communist." I was "the expression of international solidarity forged into the armed fist of the revolutionary working class by the Comintern." I was "the . . ."

"Take it easy," said a small voice within me. "You're not back home turning out party editorials. You're not a romantic­ you're a Marxist, remember? What about the dialectical contradictions . . . ?"

I did not feel like whistling any more.
