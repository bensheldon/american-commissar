After the meeting Balint, Gellert, Kovess, and I repaired to the Hungarian Workers Club Restaurant in Yorkvile and we talked.

There really wasn't any League, except on paper.

The Anti-Horthy League was a disguised attempt by the Hungarian Communist Bureau to extend its influence over the non-Communist Hungarian masses by uniting all Hungarian societies hostile to Horthy into one League secretly controlled by them. The League got off to a promising start when a number of non-Communist organizations responded to the alluring call for unity, only to withdraw hastily when Communist control became evident to them. In consequence, by the time I was elected a member of the Executive Board the League was only an empty shell desperately trying to prolong its existence, although I was not aware of this at the time.

Hugo Gellert, the president, was not a Communist Party member. He was a sincere liberal who hated all Fascists and who was convinced that the Anti-Horthy League could be of great service in curbing the Horthy terror in Hungary.

Balint, the executive official of the League, was a Communist in ideology but not officially a member of the Communist Party, either. I was convinced that he was, because he always referred to himself proudly as a Communist. Only later, when I myself became a member of the Party, did I discover that Balint had never joined. He was too much of an individualist to submit to the authority and discipline of the Communist Party.

Balint, then in his mid-thirties, was a brilliant person, a near genius albeit an erratic one. By profession he was a fresco painter specializing in restoring murals in churches. He was also a musician and composer of sorts, and a powerful writer with the emotional impact of a high-velocity shell. He wrote in Hungarian, Hungarian novels revolutionary in content which made the publication of his books in Horthy Hungary an impossibility.

The third person in the restaurant with us that evening, Louis Kovess, was a shabbily dressed man of thirty-one, of medium height, with a noble forehead and sunken cheeks. He was extremely tense and his eyes glowed with the feverish shine of the tubercular, which he was.

Kovess had been one of the leaders of the Young Communists in Hungary during the BÃ©la Kun dictatorship; it was said he had been arrested by the Horthy police but managed to escape from jail. As the Secretary of the Hungarian Bureau he exercised top leadership over all Hungarian Communists in the United States and Canada.

From that evening on I became one of the most active members in the Anti-Horthy League. Since Hugo was usually too busy with his art, this raised the number of active members in the League to two, Balint and myself. Our own activity was not overtaxing, either. It consisted mainly in the two of us getting together from time to time in my apartment, having a few drinks which Balint called "getting a perspective," and then hatching schemes. The more "perspective" we poured into ourselves the bolder the concepts became and the more feasible they appeared.

As an outcome of those "executive meetings" every once in a while we would "issue a statement," sometimes a MANIFESTO, occasionally even a PROCLAMATION in the name of the Anti-Horthy League which we claimed represented the "might of all the hundreds of organizations united against Horthy," which would then be prominently featured in the Uj Elore. In those pronouncements we would invoke dire threats against Horthy and his government, indict them under all counts ranging from castrations to murder and then brand them with our verdict "in the name of the people of Hungary" and, for good measure, in the name of "all mankind and eternal history."

At first I would question how the two of us could take on the responsibility for such sweeping statements. Balint would lecture me, explaining how the two of us, "in the larger historical sense," actually were "the true expression of the muted voices of the millions of Hungarians writhing in oppression." Besides, it was not the two of us, actually, who did the speaking; we were merely articulating "the mighty voice of the powerful Anti-Horthy League which made Horthy tremble"!

Whether we made Horthy actually tremble or not I had no means to ascertain, but we did have one yardstick by which to gauge the effect of our pontifications. When we really hit home we would be vehemently denounced by those American Hungarian newspapers which were subsidized by the Horthy government. Occasionally voices of warning would be raised against us from the various Hungarian pulpits also, thus providing a much wider dissemination of our pronouncements, even if in a negative way. We chalked up all such responses as gains and promptly issued even bolder "manifestoes."

Shortly after I had embarked on this activity our "pipeline" to the Hungarian Consulate in New York (in reality the wife of an artist whom Balint knew and who worked there as a translator) warned us that my name had been put on the Index, charging me with high treason against the Hungarian government, making me subject to immediate arrest and possible execution if I ever set foot in Hungary. It was a disturbing sensation to be so proscribed but I shrugged it off. I was an American. I had no desire whatever to return to my native land. All I was interested in was helping those poor Hungarian masses oppressed by Horthy regain their freedom. Having reasoned that out I became proud of having been placed on the Index. I had long known of Horthy, let him now know of my existence! My being put on the Index seemed to have personalized our relationship and added new zest to my activities. It is far more satisfying to stir up trouble against a dictator for whom one entertains a personal grudge.

One day Balint called me excitedly. Matthias Rakosi (sixteen years later the Communist boss of Hungary) who had been arrested in Hungary and faced a sentence of death, had gone on a hunger strike in jail. Kovess ordered that the League must take the lead to help Rakosi. We were to have an "emergency mass meeting" that night.

Only four people showed up at that emergency mass meeting: Kovess, Balint, Hugo Gellert, and myself. Kovess informed us that Rakosi had been on his hunger strike nearly a week, that protest demonstrations had been planned in Rakosi's behalf in front of the Hungarian Embassies in France and Austria, and that our League must organize a similar demonstration in Washington.

I couldn't see the point. Rakosi was a Communist, while the Anti-Horthy League was a nonpartisan, non-Communist organization. We had nothing to do with the Communists. Let the Communists demonstrate in Washington if they so desired.

Hugo and Balint kept silent. Kovess was most patient with me. The League was anti-Horthy, wasn't it? Of course it was. Rakosi was certainly anti-Horthy, wasn't he? I couldn't dispute that either. Well, didn't that make for a common cause? Besides, neither Horthy nor world opinion would pay any attention to whatever the Communists did. The "whole world" knew that the Anti-Horthy League was a non-Communist organization. I was a non-Communist, a published author. Hugo was a nonCommunist, a well-known artist. A demonstration by the League led by the two of us would carry far more weight with the public than any Communist demonstration could. If the two of us were arrested and we then told our story at the trial, that would be news and it would reach American public opinion. His exposition was logical, it definitely made sense, yet the idea of my taking part in a demonstration was repugnant to me. At that time demonstrations were still rare occurrences in the United States and the participants were generally considered to be, even by me, disreputable characters, definitely outside the pale.

The possibility of being arrested appealed to me even less. I was a law-abiding citizen. Arrest to me meant dishonor, disrepute, the antithesis of everything I strove for. In short, I was afraid, very much afraid of the consequences and attempted to hide my fear by raising various objections. The Anti-Horthy League had only three active members. How could the three of us stage a demonstration, and in Washington at that?

I was an innocent. Kovess had anticipated all my excuses and had everything planned. The Hungarian Bureau would send twenty Hungarian Communist Party members along with us from New York. They would be reinforced by thirty other Hungarian party members from Baltimore and from other near-by points in Maryland. In addition, the American Communist Party had also agreed to co-operate and promised to send us another sixty to seventy of their members. All in all we would have more than 1oo people participating.

I had nothing more to say. Kovess had confronted me with logic, facts, and figures, a combination I had never been able to resist. A demonstration it was to be, with myself as one of the two leaders. I wanted very much to back out but I couldn't see any honorable way to effect it.

The next night we left for Washington. Only five of the twenty New York Hungarian Communists promised by Kovess showed up. We had about twenty placards with us, one intended for every five demonstrators. We traveled by coach and I tried to sleep but couldn't. I, who from childhood on had intermittently been plagued by two fears, that of going blind or of being confined in an isolated jail cell, was now deliberately traveling on a train to put myself in jail. Why? How come?

I reviewed the salient points in my life. I wanted to be a writer of good plays. I wanted to know life and understand it. I dreamed about fame although not too often. I hoped to be rich but not seriously. What I wanted fundamentally was to be doing the things of which I felt myself capable. I wanted to see injustice done away with, a happy life for everyone. If I could personally help the Hungarian people regain their freedom my life would have a fuller meaning. I recalled with irony my previous trip to Washington, the first and only time I had been there. That had occurred about a year and a half before, when I was spending my vacation as a guest of a distinguished Southern family in Virginia, invited by a lady interested in getting a part in one of my plays. We had been driven to Washington by a uniformed chauffeur in a luxurious Locomobile limousine and my hosts had introduced me to their senators and congressman who greeted me with gracious charm, and who even went so far as to have the recently completed Pan-American Building opened for us when I expressed disappointment that it was closed that day.

Now I was on my way to Washington again, not in sunshine but in cold drizzling rain, not as a promising playwright but as a bum to be arrested. As I contemplated the strong possibility of going to jail I discovered that my former feeling of apprehension was gone, that it had been replaced by a growing sense of exultation. I was being called, I was being chosen. It was a spiritual glow I had never experienced before. It was as if I were floating way up high in the clear sky, supremely confident of the purity of my mission and in perfect communion with the spirit of all mankind. I believe it was a truly religious experience. I saw myself a symbolic knight riding a spirited charger to avenge injusticeâand floated off to sleep.

We arrived in Washington shortly after six in the morning, bleary-eyed and weary. We cleaned ourselves up in the washroom, smoothed our crumpled collars, straightened our ties, called up the newspapers, and then took the streetcar to the Hungarian Embassy. We saw two women waiting there and soon discovered that those two sleepy-eyed, middle-aged housewives were the sum total of all the revolutionary forces that the American Communist Party and the Hungarian Bureau were jointly able to mobilize from all of Washington, Baltimore, and the State of Maryland. Discouraging as that was, Gellert and I adjusted ourselves to the existing situation.

There we were, nine of us, clustered around the Embassy and not another soul in sight. The gate to the building was shut, the windows closed and dark, the Embassy appeared abandoned.

I was neither nervous nor afraid any more. It was cold and drizzling. I was carrying about a half dozen rolled up placards under my arms bearing slogans such as "DOWN WITH THE MURDEROUS HORTHY GOVERNMENT," "HUNGARY NEEDS BREAD AND FREEDOMâNOT GALLOWS," "FREE MATTIAS RAKOSI," and so on. There had been one stating "HANDS OFF HAITI," but I couldn't see what Horthy or Rakosi had to do with Haiti and I had left that one in the train.

About an hour passed and the group was getting impatient. We were a sorry, rain-soaked lot, looking more like shivering pedestrians waiting for a streetcar than a determined band of avengers ready to shake to their foundations the pillars of the Horthy government.

We were anxious to get started but Hugo wanted to wait until the newspapermen showed up.

After a while our group attracted the attention of a passing policeman. He continued his walk to the corner and then stopped, watching us from a distance. It was getting close to nine o'clock in the morning and there was some traffic on the street now. Hugo and I agreed we might as well start.

I lined up the people in single file, spaced six feet apart to make the line look longer, rolled one of my placards down in front of me, and told the others to do the same. With each of us displaying a poster the line seemed transformed; stretched out to nearly sixty feet it looked definitely impressive. Hugo and I took position in the lead and then we started marching. I glanced in the direction of the policeman on the corner to see how he reacted in order to formulate my plans accordingly. He was hurrying away.

It was a most awkward line. We were nervous and couldn't keep six feet apart, we would unconsciously bunch up to avoid the sense of isolation around that deserted building.

The few passers-by gave us a quick glance, then hurried awayâthat was all the notice we attracted. I brought the column to a halt, there seemed to be no sense to it that way. We went into a huddle and decided to shout so as to provoke some reaction from inside the Embassy. Each of us began to yell but the sound seemed to die, absorbed by that big stone building and by the broad empty street.

We changed to shouting in unison, chanting: "Free Rakosi!" "Down with the Horthy government!" That sounded better. A few passers-by stopped. We were drawing a crowd, although not a big one. They watched us from the curb, not too curious, merely to see what might develop, with that half-interested stare accorded to freaks outside the tent of a side show, all right for free, but not worth the price of admission.

A porter from inside the Embassy now came up to the gate and watched us impassively. We continued marching and chanting in a desultory fashion. It was getting to be a bore, also ridiculous. We were all dejected. My throat was getting hoarse, my arms were tired from holding my poster and carrying that additional bundle of placards under my arm. It was an unnatural position. I had to keep my arms glued to my side, I couldn't raise my elbows or the roll would have fallen.

Suddenly the crowd, which had been slowly increasing, showed a quick sign of excitement. All faces turned to the corner. Six policemen with a sergeant in the lead were coming down the street. Our line tensed. The policemen carried big revolvers in open holsters, held their night clubs gripped in their hands with the black straps hanging from their wrists. They were big beefy	men. They were not marching, just walking, heading straight toward us. It was a menacing sight, doom about to descend. The police were now only a few steps away and relentlessly closing in. I stiffened and shouted:

"Free Rakosi! Down with the Horthy government!" The sound did not come out as loud as I intended. A few of the demonstrators responded, but not above a mumble.

The sergeant came right up to me, tightening his grip on his night stick. I drew a deep breath and straightened up. We were face to face, his eyes boring into mine. My neck turned rigid in anticipation of the blow.

"What are you doing here, boys?" His voice was gruff but not hostile, he was on official business and he wanted to know. The tenseness in my neck eased but my muscles were still coiled.

"Demonstrating against Horthy," I replied. He seemed to contemplate that for a second, so I followed it up with further explanation. He listened for a few moments then cut in.

"All right, you've demonstrated enough. Now hand me those posters and go home." While he spoke the other policemen went around and confiscated the placards. There was no rough stuff. They simply reached for the posters and took them. They met no opposition. I sensed that psychologically there couldn't be any resistance, yet that was still wrong.

The sergeant reached for my poster and took it from my hands. Then he pointed to the rolled-up bundle under my arm.

"How about those?" he said.

Somebody had to offer resistance.

"I am going to keep them!" I defied him and tightened my hug on the roll.

"O.K., keep them," he shrugged. "Now get going, break it up." By then his men were efficiently separating the demonstrators from each other. The sergeant next turned to the crowd, which was sizeable by now.

"O.K., break it upâget going. It's all overâkeep going, keep going." The crowd obediently dissolved into individuals, each proceeding on his own way. Our people were moving singly toward the corner. Hugo and I remained standing where we were. The policemen barely glanced at us. Just then a taxi pulled up spilling three newsmen and we saw another one sauntering up the street. They talked with the sergeant and then came up to Hugo and me, wanting to know what was up. We gave them the information but they did not appear much interested, took only a few notes. The sergeant then told them and us that that was enough, and we all left, the newspapermen going in one direction, we to the corner where our people were waiting. We instructed them to meet us at the railroad station.

On the train back to New York the demonstrators were elated, recalling to each other in detail just what each of them did and said, what a successful demonstration that had been.

I felt weary and grossly deflated. I was no longer the shining knight and appeared ridiculous even in my own eyes. The entire performance was silly and senseless, the demonstration had accomplished nothing.

That judgment proved wrong. The demonstration made the Washington papers. The news had also been transmitted by the wire services; some of the New York papers picked it up. Abroad, that news item was prominently displayed in the Communist and Socialist press and even in some liberal papers; it made the front page of Pravda and other Soviet papers. The greatest significance of the story was that the demonstration had taken place in Washington, citadel of the greatest capitalist nation in the world. That story gave spurt to other demonstrations in other parts of the globe, including Latin and South America. Because of that world-wide spotlight, Admiral Horthy did not dare to have Rakosi executed; he commuted his sentence to twenty years' imprisonment.

My judgment had been based on what had actually happened, on our sorry showing in Washington. I had failed to comprehend how well Kovess understood the art of propaganda.

Our demonstration had indeed saved Rakosi's life.

When Rakosi was installed in power by the Soviet Red Army in Hungary some sixteen years later the Socialists and Liberals everywhere were too disunited to organize demonstrations to save the lives of the untold numbers of Liberal and Socialist Hungarians Rakosi had sentenced to the gallows. Not that it would have mattered. Rakosi, as a Communist, understood full well the power of aroused public opinionâhe owed his life to it. When he came into power he saw to it, through terror and censorship, that public opinion reflected but one point of view.

His!
