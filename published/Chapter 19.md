As I entered the meeting hail of the Anti-Horthy League in the Hungarian section of Yorkvile I was rather disappointed in the size of the audience. In my inexperience I had expected to find at least a few hundred people at a meeting supposedly "public" but I counted only fourteen including the three men on the platform, one of whom was Balint. The meeting was already in progress. Balint was speaking but no one seemed to be paying him any attention, the audience was engaged in private conversations of their own. As I made my way to a seat in the rear all eyes regarded me with curiosity and what seemed to me suspicion. I must have been the only "new face" there.

Hugo Gellert, a prominent Hungarian artist widely known for his drawings in the Sunday World magazine section, was presiding. He had received considerable publicity a little while back when he was fired by the World for refusing to tone down his illustrations for a series of articles dealing with the brutal excesses of Mussolini's Fascist government in Italy. As Gellert related it to me later, the publishers had called him in and told him:

"When we hired you we thought that we were hiring an artist. We find we have hired a radical."

Hugo Gellert's answer was equally to the point:

"When you hired me you thought you were hiring a prostitute. You find you have hired a man."

I do not now recall whether it was Gellert or Balint who gave the main address. The speaker talked about the necessity of fighting the Horthy terror which, translated by him, meant building the League. Later I was to learn that formula well. In left-wing circles to fight for or against any cause is always equated with building the organization.

The discussion was mostly about the long-overdue issue of the Anti-Horthy League magazine. The League had difficulty in raising the required funds and in consequence the monthly had not been coming out monthly at all.

Before the close of the meeting Balint called on me publicly to join the League. This unexpected invitation took me unawares. I replied I had not given it any thought as yet, besides as I understood from that meeting, the Anti-Horthy League was an affiliation of Hungarian societies and not an organization of individual members.

Balint said that was right but I could join the League as an unofficial representative of the Furriers Union. I replied that I had withdrawn from that union, foremen did not have to belong.

Balint still persisted, wanting to know what other organizations I belonged to. At first I thought of the Green Room Club. I had joined that once when it looked as if my first play was about to go into production but resigned shortly afterward, finding it a waste of time. I really wasn't a joiner. Finally I remembered Murphy's Democratic Assembly Club. I had not quit that, I simply never went back again. Perhaps that might do.

"The only organization I belong to is the Democratic Assembly Club," I informed him.

There was a loud gasp. It came from a girl whom I later came to know as Blond Elsie. She was a natural "gasper" which made her presence a valuable addition to all protest meetings. She was a person easily astounded, horrified, made indignant, or filled with sorrow; a veritable human organ who responded instantly to all such calls to emotion with a solitary but powerful gasp. She had a deep bass voice due to a prenatal obstruction in her throat which enabled her to project her gasp to the very last row in the audienceâ€”a great political asset in the radical movement.

Balint looked at me incredulously. Could I have been betraying him?

"The Democratic Party, did you say?" he reproached me, sounding shocked.

I was aware I had started something although I wasn't sure what. I explained how I had gone and enrolled immediately after having received my citizenship papers. That was the first time since the start of the meeting that all conversation on the floor had ceased. They listened to the explanation of my motives in attentive silence as if in court.

When I finished Balint looked relieved. He and Gellert went into a hurried consultation with a third person referred to as "Comrade Kovess" who had been sitting alongside of them at the presiding table. (I was introduced to him after the meeting, his full name was Louis Kovess and Balint whispered impressively that he was the "Secretary of the Hungarian Bureau," making it sound important.)

After their consultation Balint announced officially that everything was in order, they would expunge from the minutes that I was a member of the Democratic Assembly Club and the bylaws of the League were hereby amended to allow for individual membership. It was a simple solution. Rules are made by men and can be unmade by them.

I was in and was immediately appointed to the Press and Publicity Committee and also to the Executive Board of the League.

They certainly recognized talent when they saw it. I felt rather flattered.
