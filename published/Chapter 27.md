The <em>Uj Elore</em> was a Communist newspaper, which is quite different from the concept generally evoked by the term "newspaper." Its main function was not the dissemination of news but agitation and propaganda. Every item it published had to carry a strong Communist slant. The capitalists had to be portrayed as brutal subhumans and the proletarians as either akin to angels in virtue, or as cruelly wronged victims of the capitalist system.

The editor was Lajos Bebrits, a tall imposing man weighing over two hundred pounds, with a friendly smile and deceptively shy academic manners. He was then just under forty, a former railroad official in Hungary, a revolutionary from his youth, who had fled jail to come to the United States.

Bebrits was a man of encyclopedic knowledge who towered head and shoulders in intellect and character above everyone else in the Hungarian movement. He took an instant liking to me, the only friend I was to have on that staff.

The news editor was John Nagy, his real name Joseph Gyetvay, a former Catholic priest defrocked for his revolutionary activities in Hungary. He was around forty; somewhat hunched from the habit of carrying one shoulder higher than the other with his neck held to one side, as if fearful of a blow. He was a secretive, humorless, uncommunicative man with a narrow sectarian outlook and rather limited mentality. To my surprise he was a writer of penny proletarian novels in which idealized but sterile housemaids were relentlessly pursued and cruelly forced to submit to the lust of depraved, sex-fiend aristocrats whose diet, because of their wealth, consisted exclusively of caviar, roast pheasant and champagne, nutritionally a rather poor fare. (The last I heard, Gyetvay was in Ankara, the Hungarian ambassador to Turkey.)

The third man on the staff was Emery Lustig, a young, broad-shouldered soccer-football player who was esteemed an excellent organizer because of the effective way he was dealing with the Hungarian followers of Lovestone who refused to embrace the new Foster line. There was nothing subtle about his methods; he would invade a Lovestoneite meeting with his gang and break it up physically. (The last I heard he was district leader of an electrical workers' union allegedly still under Communist control somewhere in New York State.)

The fourth man was John Santo, a member of the illegal Young Communist movement in Rumania before he came to the United States on a student visa. He had been working as a barber in Chicago before Nagy brought him to the <em>Uj Elore</em> staff. (He was to rise to a high position in the government Meat Trust in Communist Hungary after having been deported from here.)

The <em>Uj Elore</em> was a national daily with a circulation Of 50,000 from New York to California. Most of our copies went by mail to subscribers who would receive them anywhere from one to five days after publication. Under those circumstances it mattered very little whether the news in the <em>Uj Elore</em> was printed one or even three days after the event occurred.

Our favorite news source was the New York Times. The news we clipped had to have class interest and we would rewrite it to suit the policy of our paper. Of course all newspapers, capitalist or Communist, reflect the policy of the publisher. However, when it came to slanting the news we had no peers—even Time magazine was a novice by comparison. The Time staff had greater finesse because of the higher cultural level of their subscribers yet we had the edge on them because we were not handicapped by a feeling of delicacy among our readers. Where Time magazine had to resort to some such mild adjective as "unkempt" to create a subtle prejudice against a labor organizer, we could bluntly call a capitalist "bloated," and if we wanted to please our readers even more, we would add "with the blood of workers."

The two examples cited below should suffice to illustrate how we treated our news stories. Both items were clipped from the inside pages of the New York Times, recorded there in a few brief lines.

The first reported an explosion in a coal mine in West Virginia in which two miners with garbled but unmistakably Hungarian names were killed, and three injured; it said that an investigation had been started to determine the cause of the accident. I was handed that news item to rewrite and did so carefully, correcting the spelling of the names of the victims, and then handed it to Nagy. After Nagy read it he snorted, gave me a withering glance, and retired with it to his desk. A short while later when reading proof on his version of that item, I had no doubt left in me about my "lack of political development."

The story carried a five-column headline.

<blockquote>BLOOD FEEDS COAL BARONS' GREED</blockquote>

It was subheaded:

<blockquote>Coal Profits Demand New Human Victims</blockquote>

A lower subhead proclaimed:

<blockquote><em>Fresh Orphans and Widows for Wall Street Molochs</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>
Wheeling, W. Va. The grinning death skulls of the Coal Barons, those blood brothers of the Wall Street imperialist finance capitalists, are again licking their greasy chops in glee. They have just fed anew on miners' flesh, on miners' steaming blood to satisfy their blood-bloated bellies. Those vampires chose for their latest victims two unfortunate Hungarian workers who had fled the brutal, torturing, Fascist hyenas of Horthy Hungary only to die in agony on the profit-slippery altars of American plutocracy.
</blockquote>

The story then gave a bloodcurdling description of the explosion, of the scorching flames and choking fumes, gave precise details of how the two miners were mangled by the collapsing walls of the tunnels, and how the blast seared and injured many other miners who at that writing were on the verge of death, writhing in pain.

Next it went into a denunciation of Wall Street, the coal barons, the Horthy government, charging them all with special responsibility for that disaster. The news story ended with a ringing appeal to all Hungarian miners to join the National Miners Union, under the leadership of the Communist Party, and subscribe to the <em>Uj Elore</em> which could never be bought, nor intimidated, which alone told the truth!

I congratulated Nagy on that story, praising his insight. He wasn't gracious in accepting my compliments. He implied that I could read Marx until doomsday and still fail to become a good Communist reporter; to write a good Communist news story one had to be part of the class struggle.

The second story, that impressed me even more, had also been written by Nagy. It was based on a brief dispatch in the New York Times stating that the Budapest police had arrested three cabinetmakers for distributing Communist propaganda leaflets in their shop. Without giving any further details, the dispatch concluded by saying that the police were investigating the source of those leaflets.

The next day the <em>Uj Elore</em> carried this eight-column headline:

<blockquote>THE HORTHY GOVERNMENT IS QUAKING!</blockquote>

It was subheaded:

<blockquote>Savage Reprisals, Bloody Police Terror fail to Prevent Bold Communist Action.</blockquote>

The lead went something like this:

<Blockquote>
Terror struck today in the heart of the murderous, degenerate, bloodsucking ruling class of Hungary. Panicked by fear, they again hid behind the shutters of their castles built with the blood of the destitute Hungarian workers and peasants. Once more they shriveled under the hot breath of revolt, heard the crowing of the red rooster setting flame to their rooftops. The proletariat of Hungary received new hope and courage from this fearless and bold action of the underground Communist Party which raised its red banner high to show that the time of the final reckoning is rapidly approaching.
</blockquote>

It was a three column long story, all based on that six-line news item in the New York Times. That was dialectical materialism in practice, a science that not only foretells the future but also divines the past. That couldn't be learned from books either, you had to live it to master it.

Once I nearly came close to it. We were short of a filler for our Sunday supplement and I was handed a large glossy of a French movie actress on the Riviera wearing a fabulous half-million-dollar pearl necklace. I was asked to write an appropriate caption for it.

It was quite a photo. Posed by a French photographer, the lady had laid bare practically all but her soul—the pearls were the least of her physical attractions. I sat gazing at that enticing figure for a long time trying to class-angle it. Finally I gave up, oblivious of my political inadequacy. Just for fun, to spoof that solemn Nagy, I wrote:

<blockquote>
X-Y, celebrated actress, favorite playmate of the parasitic scions of the ruthless oppressors of the French toilers, displaying her fabulous pearls worth $500,000, the cost of which has been squeezed out of the hide of the starving French masses.
</blockquote>

I was grinning when I handed it to Nagy. He didn't notice that. He read the caption carefully, reached for his pencil and made a few corrections.

He changed <em>playmate</em> to <em>concubine</em>, <em>celebrated</em> to <em>notorious</em>, <em>displaying</em> to <em>brazenly flaunting</em>, raised the $500,000 to a million, and stuck the adjective <em>feudal</em> in front of the noun <em>oppressors</em>. Otherwise it had passed the test.

Evidently I had acquired the secret yet I made little use of it. Every time I caught myself straying into that kind of Communist journalism I simply recalled those pearls, grinned, and stopped in time.

Our fiction was clipped mostly from the German Communist newspapers—this was before Hitler. Once, tired of translating those dull and repetitious stories, I protested to Bebrits. In those German Communist epics the capitalists were invariably inhuman, cunning and cowardly monsters while the workers were all outspoken and self-sacrificing heroic demigods.

I told Bebrits those conceptions were childish, that the true picture was quite the opposite. Most workers were far from being outspoken; in my personal experience they were a most easily intimidated lot. I proposed that I rewrite those stories, adding a touch of reality, thus making them more believable to the workers who could then see a closer resemblance to themselves.

This was in the evening, after the paper had been put to bed and the two of us were left alone in the office.

Bebrits sighed, stuck his pen wearily into his inkpot, stretched, and then leaned back in his chair.

"You are an intelligent person," he addressed me mildly, "a man of culture, which is rare among our young Hungarian comrades. Yet you don't know about workers at all."

I protested that immediately. I knew workers, I had worked in shops with them for eight years, I had eaten with them, stood in the fur market with them, I was on familiar terms with more workers than the rest of the <em>Uj Elore</em> staff put together. In fact, I was the only genuine manual worker on the entire staff.

Bebrits heard me out and then replied.

"You know individual workers, but not the working class. The average worker is a piece of turd, a cowardly, cunning, selfish, double-crossing, often moronic son of a bitch. He is deformed in body by toil and warped in mind, willing to betray his own grandmother. He is servile and fawns on his boss, ready to tuck in his wagging tail and run at the first harsh word from his master."

I looked at Bebrits in astonishment. I would never have gone that far in my indictment. Bebrits continued, his eyes lost in contemplation.

"I know what workers are like from way back when I was assistant railroad station master in Transylvania. Of course not all workers fit that description. I know workers from that famous railroad strike in Hungary during World War I that set Germany's Rumanian offensive back an entire week by stopping all troop movements.

"What good would it do to the working class or to the Communist Party to depict the workers as they are, to hold a mirror up to them and say, 'Take a look at yourself and see what miserable crud you are!' The worker knows that better than we do, he would crawl back deeper into his dank crevice, even more hopeless, even more dejected and defeated.

"What do we do? We paint him a picture which shows him a giant with the features of Apollo and the muscles of Hercules, brave as Mars and towering like Jupiter.

"We keep presenting him with this picture and drumming into him: This is your portrait, this is the true mirror. All other mirrors are deceptive, they have always been deceptive, they were purposely so invented by the capitalists to reflect a distorted image in order to keep you humble and ignorant, to hide your real strength and character from you.

"We keep drilling that into his head, we play up examples, we portray situations where the hero—and the hero is always the worker—performs the most prodigious feats of daring, until the worker starts rubbing his eyes, begins flexing his muscles and vaguely wonders if he isn't actually the kind of worker we insist he is, instead of the miserable wretch he knows himself to be.

"We give him self-confidence and some day, somewhere, the occasion arises where he is put to test. He will inevitably be provoked by some exceptionally revolting act of capitalist injustice, some stupid act of suppression, some extremely cruel act of exploitation which capitalism by its very nature must historically invoke. He will then remember the countless examples we have cited him and, as likely as not, he will rise to the occasion. He will then discover that there is truth in what we have said, that by virtue of his overwhelming numerical superiority he is far stronger, more capable of revolutionary action than he has ever believed himself to be.

"Even though he still has his own doubts about himself, he believes that the other workers with him are more of that heroic mold. Thus he gains strength from the presumed courage of his fellow workers and finds that mass courage really is superior, that ultimately it can sweep all resistance away.

"This is why, comrade, you just go back and keep translating those fictional stories as they are published in those German magazines. The German Communist Party is the largest party outside of the Soviet Union. The German comrades know best how to transform that miserable wretch of a worker into a fighting revolutionary hero. In a few years you will see how that transformed German revolutionary worker will sweep the Krupps, the Junkers into the ash heap of history, how those German workers will plant the red banner of the successful proletarian revolution firmly in Europe for the rest of the nations to follow."

I had no grounds to dispute the correctness of that theoretical foundation of Communist propaganda although I was of the opinion that Bebrits was far more contemptuous of the individual worker than the facts warranted. That conversation took place in the fall of 1929 and subsequent developments in Germany tended to bear out Bebrits' words concerning the psychology of the worker. However, actual events proved different in one basic essential from Bebrits' prophecy. Hitler and Goebbels, who took that line over from the Communists, proved greater masters in its application—they were the ones who convinced the German masses that they were the <em>Herrenvolk</em> whose superiority destined them to rule over all other nations—and it is now a matter of historical record that they nearly succeeded. But that was still in the future that evening. As our talk became more intimate I pressed Bebrits for the details of that railroad strike in Transylvania. He was at first reluctant but he yielded finally. As he went deeper into his story, he became more and more animated and I found myself transported back to the years of the First World War in Hungary.

The Germans under Field Marshal von Mackensen were then concentrating for an all-out assault on Rumania to knock that country completely out of the war. The hub of all railroads from Germany to Rumania was Temesvár, where Bebrits held a comparatively high post for a young man then in his twenties, that of Assistant to the Station Master. The railroad workers in that town had chosen that moment to demonstrate their antiwar sentiments and went on strike, bringing all rail traffic to a halt. The German High Command responded by arresting hundreds of railway workers, threatening to shoot all of them unless they resumed work. The railway workers held out. Mass executions were about to begin when suddenly Bebrits volunteered to take a hand. He was well liked and respected by all ranks and when he approached the higher railroad officials with his plan they were happy to recommend him to the German High Command.

Bebrits offered to persuade the men to go back to work and start traffic moving under two conditions: that all death sentences be revoked and all other retaliatory measures be canceled. He also wanted permission to speak privately with the arrested men. Those requests were granted. The men returned to work and Bebrits took over.

To the delight of the military, the most feverish activity in railroading history developed instantaneously right under their own eyes. Locomotives were getting up pressure, black smoke and white steam poured from the long-dormant funnels. Engines started puffing and snorting all along the tracks. Jets of hot white steam hissed round the elbow-shaped, shiny steel driving-shafts, punctuated by short penetrating toots of railroad whistles. Trains shunted back and forth, cars were coupled and uncoupled. Bumpers clashed, transmitting a shivery impact from car to car along the length of the trains—each car came alive with a shock when it received the rude jolt and passed along the momentum, snake-like, to the next car, to the delight of the military.

The German Army Command was fascinated, that was railroading at its peak of perfection, the Christmas dream of a child come true. Semaphores flashed red, green, and yellow, their arms went up and down or halfway; brakemen signaled with their red flags by day, with the arclike movement of red lanterns by night. Every railroad man was at work, every car was in motion, the rails were hot with friction, the flashing wheels glimmered silvery by the light of the stars.

It took days before the German Military Command discovered that with all that day-and-night feverish activity not a single train got through, that every southbound train was now facing north, that military units had been broken up and separated, that guns had been divorced from their ammunition and, worse still, every crossing, every switch was blocked by a long string of cars. It was the traffic jam of the century. The harder Bebrits worked the worse the tangle became.

They called Bebrits on the carpet but they couldn't prove their suspicions. Bebrits had been working day and night without sleep, his eyes were bloodshot and circled, he was near the point of exhaustion. He had shouted himself hoarse and he could barely whisper his rebuttal that that was the way of railroading, that all the trains were in motion, that the men had kept their pledge and were carrying out all orders faithfully. Not having any tangible proof, the military had to let Bebrits go.

It took four more days before the first train finally left for the Rumanian border. The news of that exploit spread like wildfire throughout the land, it sparked further antimilitary resistance. Bebrits was eventually jailed for sabotage but he wouldn't tell me about that part and I did not want to press him.

That was the kind of revolutionary inspiration I had been looking for, it deepened my respect for the old-time revolutionary leaders. We discussed many topics that evening, points about Communism that bothered me, particularly dialectics and historical materialism. I questioned the accuracy of that supposedly scientific guide to the foretelling of the future development of history. My question was, what would happen to that theory after the establishment of Communism when the opposing class forces presumably disappeared

Bebrits' eyes took on a dreamy look. He pondered the question and then replied that there would always be opposing forces. The struggle in society would then move on to a higher plane. A society then might clash over the kind of music to play, over the kind of poetry to write, whether to increase the population or to apply compulsory birth control, and so on. No society would ever be in full equilibrium, there would always be forces that clashed. But that was all in the future, something for our grandchildren to face.

From that evening on, Bebrits and I became rather close, but our relationship was soon to be interrupted. Summoned to an inquiry into Communism by the Hamilton Fish Congressional Committee in 1930, Bebrits did not evoke the Fifth Amendment but attested his faith in Communism and was subsequently ordered deported. He went to the Soviet Union where he became a trouble-shooter in the reorganization of the Soviet railways. He wrote a few times at first; then I lost track of him.

In the late fifties I came across a short feature story in an American magazine or newspaper describing a fully operating small-scale railroad with miles of tracks built by the Ministry of Transport in Communist Hungary for the amusement of children near Budapest. The children had full rights to run the locomotives, to man the switches and signals by themselves and thus become educated in the ways of railroading. Even though that article did not identify the Minister of Transport by name until the very end I guessed who he was right from the start.

It was my friend Bebrits all right.
