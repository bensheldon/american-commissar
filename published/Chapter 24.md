One night, weeks later, I received a telephone call; it was the unit organizer. She sounded both plaintive and excited. Where had I been? What had happened? To shake her off, I told her I was being kept busy in the shop. I am a poor liar and my excuse sounded lame even to me.

Her mind wasn't on that. "You must come to a special meeting tomorrow night. You absolutely must be there," she said with a trace of hysteria in her voice, brushing my excuses aside.

"I can't tell you why, over the phone. You're the huskiest man in our unit and we're all depending on you." That made me vaguely uneasy.

"I'm sorry but I can't make it," I told her firmly.

"But you must, comrade, you must. Our entire plan is built around you." She was practically crying. "Maybe you're afraid? You are not really afraid, comrade, are you?" she screeched.

I wasn't, not until then. But when she raised that question I immediately became so, which gave rise to the urge to deny it. I told her I would be there and she hung up in happy relief.

I felt neither happy nor relieved. I had three clues to go on. They considered me husky, they wanted me to do something that required physical display of strength, and there was danger involved. What did they want me to do? Beat up somebody? Throw a bomb? As I pondered over it I became aware of actual fear. My imagination was racing wild.

Had they picked me to shoot it out with prison guards, to assassinate someone, to lead an attack on Wall Street? I tried to reduce it to absurdity to allay my apprehensions.

I was wretched and miserable when I crawled into bed that night, dreading what the morrow would bring. Paradoxically, the one thought that would have eliminated the problem at a single stroke, that of not appearing at that meeting, did not occur to me. That would have been contrary to my innate sense of honoring an obligation.

Section Party headquarters was packed that night. The crowd was far bigger than usual and since the number of chairs was the same, more people had to stand. I noticed an intermingling of the units that usually met separately, the comrades were agitatedly conversing with each other. As soon as she spied me the unit organizer came over to me, gave me her biggest gold-toothed smile, and said she knew the unit could depend on me, that she had assured the unit I was the most sincere new comrade she had seen in years, and kept generally gushing over me. I resented that fussing and thought I would let her discover soon enough how mistaken she was in her judgment of me.

When the meeting came to order there was but one point on the agenda—a mass demonstration slated for Saturday. The new District Organizer, I. Amter, intent on "bolshevizing the Communist Party" and turning it into "a real fighting arm of the working class," had called for a militant mass demonstration to protest the sending of additional American Marines to Haiti. The demonstration was scheduled to take place in front of the New York Post Office downtown in defiance of a police ban, and a police attack was definitely anticipated. I wasn't much interested; Haiti was merely a geographical location to me.

It soon developed why my unit needed me. My unit had been assigned one of the big placards and I had been selected, as the unanimous choice of the unit, to carry it. We were instructed that the police would concentrate its attack on smashing those placards and we were to defend them. Other, smaller placards would be carried under overcoats or rolled up under the arm to be displayed at the right moment. Amter would lead the demonstration in person.

My first reaction was a definite letdown. Is that why they called me, to march around with a large placard like the bums advertising Max's Busy Bee? Had I been asked to throw a hand grenade at City Hall I would have been more gratified. The demonstration was not exactly devoid of danger, the possibility of being attacked by the police, of being shot at, arrested and jailed was not one to be contemplated with equanimity. But I had faced that threat once before in Washington when demonstrating for Rakosi. I accepted my assignment as a test of my courage which, for my own self-respect, needed reassurance badly.

The demonstration was to be a city-wide one, ours was only one of the sections participating. The Daily Worker had headlined that coming event for days, ordering all party members, under threat of expulsion, to turn out for the demonstration, and most of the front page of that day's issue of the <em>Daily Worker</em> had been devoted to mobilization for that supreme effort. We were going to have a real army, I thought, and that picture gave me confidence.

Saturday morning dawned gray and cold and drizzly again, just like that time in Washington. I got dressed, paid my rent two months in advance, just in case, so I wouldn't be dispossessed if arrested. At that time I was wholly ignorant of American court procedures, of the legal safeguards protecting the accused in a democratic society, of bail, trial, sentence. I still thought in terms of the administration of justice in Hungary, where once arrested they threw you in jail and kept you there without trial as long as they pleased.

The demonstration was scheduled to start at eleven in the morning. We were to assemble at Section Headquarters at nine-thirty at the latest, pick up our placards, literature and leaflets, and leave by ten o'clock in small groups. At City Hall Square we were to form into units, the units into sections in their given order, and then march in a single mass column on to the Post Office where Amter and other speakers would attempt to address the crowd. It was quite a well-thought-out military operation except for a provision for reserves, and it merited respect.

At nine o'clock sharp I left my home. I knew that would get me there a bit early but I was too keyed up to dally around. I forced myself to take slow steps and to look into shop windows to while away the time. I arrived at headquarters building at 9:25, just the right time. I walked up expecting to find a large crowd. When I reached the top of the stairs the door was open but the hall looked dark. I saw the shadow of a man just inside the doorway, he must have arrived only a minute or two before me. When he switched on the light his face looked somewhat familiar, he must have been the Comrade janitor in charge of the hail.

That empty hail in that dim illumination looked dismal, and it was filthy with rubbish, cigarette butts on the floor, the chairs facing whichever way in hangoverish disarray. The appearance of that hall made me recoil in disgust. What was I doing there? Why was I getting mixed up with that queer messy bunch?

"Where are the rest of the comrades?" I demanded sharply.

"They'll be here," said the Comrade janitor with indifference.

"We were all supposed to meet here at 9:30 and it's 9:30 now," I asserted.

He shrugged his shoulders. "They'll be here," he repeated.

"But we're having a big demonstration today!" I exclaimed in exasperation.

He shuffled over to me. He was a shabbily dressed, unshaved person, a worn-out, beaten down, superannuated waiter or cloakmaker operator such as you see all over the slum districts without giving them a second look.

"You're a new comrade, ain't you?" he asked. I couldn't see what that had to do with it.

"You new comrades are always in a hurry. You want to see a revolution ipsky-shmipsky right on the dot. It was the same way in Kiev in 1905 when we did have a revolution. Comrade, this is not Russia, this is America. The revolution will take a long time to come. I won't see it, you won't see it, your children won't see it. It will come, but it won't come on time."

I wasn't asking for philosophical dissertation, I wanted action. "What about the demonstration?" I demanded.

"It will be held, don't worry. If not in the morning, in the afternoon it will be held. The comrades will be there, the Post Office will be there, Haiti will be there, the police will be there, everything will be there. The comrades like to sleep late Saturday. So keep your shirt on."

I left him and went down to Horn & Hardart for another breakfast to give me something to do. I deliberately stayed away until after ten. Let them wait for me now.

It didn't work out that way. There were still merely a dozen or so people in the hall when I returned. My unit organizer was there, she was all dressed up, eager and excited as if going to a party. The other women comrades appeared similarly dressed up and stimulated. My observations later made me conclude that women in general are less apprehensive about being physically harmed. Putting women in the front line of action when violence is anticipated has always been sound revolutionary tactics. First, because women usually exhibit more militancy; secondly, the enemy, usually men, is far more reluctant to employ the same degree of brutality when faced with women that it would use against men alone. As to the morality of exposing women to the danger of physical assault, the revolutionaries make up their own moral code to suit their aims. . . .

At ten-thirty the hall was still quite empty although we were supposed to have left that hail by ten; we were now a half hour late and not even the placards had been delivered. Finally the placards arrived and I was given mine. It was about thirty-six by twenty-four inches, made of heavy cardboard nailed to a crossbar fashioned of one-by-two white pine, designed to be hung from a hook screwed into a four foot pole also made of pine. The pole was roughly planed and the placard read:

<blockquote>
H  A  N  D  S
O  F  F
H  A  I  T  I
JOIN THE COMMUNIST PARTY!
</blockquote>

We decided to wait until eleven for the others to show up. When we finally left at 11 :30 we were still only about thirty-five strong, although the party plan called for at least three hundred from our section. Out of my unit of fifteen, outside of the unit organizer, the Agit-Prop and myself, only two other comrades, both women, put in an appearance. The unit organizer expressed the hope that the others would meet us at the square. I laughed cynically. I was rehearsing a speech in my mind which I was planning to deliver to her right after the demonstration. It was to go something like this:

"Listen, sweetheart! I carried your placard, I went to your demonstration, I bought your literature, I gave you money. But that is all your Communist Party will ever get out of me. You write and it makes no sense, you make speeches and they have no meaning, you plan and it is all on paper. You go on, piddle with your Communist Party, but I have other, more important work to do. Now good-bye comrade, give my love to the proletariat."

It was quite a satisfying speech and the longer I waited in that hail for the comrades to arrive the more I embellished it until it became polished like dialogue in a play yet to be written. I was itching to deliver it to her right there and then but to have it sound really effective—that had to wait until after the demonstration.

We took the Broadway subway downtown, traveling in groups of two and three in a conspiratorial fashion, acting as if we did not know each other. We were about as inconspicuous as a flock of sheep on Madison Avenue but it did not matter. The other occupants of the subway car contemplated us with that vacant curiosity New Yorkers would give to anything, including sheep.

When we arrived at City Hall, instead of the thousands I was led to expect I found only a few hundred people who looked like comrades. They loitered around with a furtive air, elaborately avoiding recognition of each other. Some of them carried pine posts similar to mine, hiding the placards under their overcoats.

We stood around until Amter arrived. He was about fifty, tall and lean, smooth-shaven, with a sharply chiseled profile, his jaw twisted slightly to one side. He was surrounded by some of his lieutenants and appeared too nervous to be a good leader, but when I saw his eyes it was all right, it wasn't from fear. I had developed a sort of apprehension over the fate of this demonstration, I feared that it would turn out to be a fizzle, very much like that open air meeting our unit had held. I didn't give a hoot about Haiti but once I had committed myself to that demonstration I wanted to see it through. As soon as I had laid eyes on Amter from a close distance I knew that the demonstration would go through, even if not on schedule, even if only a fraction of the comrades would turn out for it.

Soon the word came down and we formed into an irregular column, four-five-six in a file. I took my place next to the unit organizer. She was a peculiar person, but basically nice; I wanted to protect her.

We marched a short distance to what I guessed was the Post Office, a grimy old stone building, as I recall. A narrow sidewalk ran all around it, at least we circled it, marching around and around in silence without crossing another street.

Policemen were stationed all over the place. They were nervous and apprehensive, fingering their clubs, alternately tightening and releasing their grip. I observed a strong line of them drawn up on the far side of the sidewalk, and a number of mounted police were patrolling the street that separated us from them. The horses were excited, they kept neighing and rearing, the police who rode them were taut and nervous, which made us taut and nervous also. Those sleek, well-fed horses loomed huge and threatening, arousing the primitive dread of the beast. As I watched the horses clawing the pavement with their hoofs, champing at the bit, their beefy, powerfully built riders with clubs and pistols openly exposed holding them in rein with effort, my mind flashed back to the quivering Indians of Mexico when they were first faced by the mounted monsters of Cortez. We shuffled around in tense silence, around and around that Post Office endlessly, when the order came down to shout slogans. I couldn't think of any. Then I remembered the slogan on my placard and started crying:

"Hands off Haiti! Hands off Haiti!"

Everybody was shouting his own slogan and it made quite a noise although the words were indistinguishable. We expected the police to charge us at any moment and were bracing ourselves to meet it but nothing happened, and soon the order came down to raise our placards which until then we had kept hidden under our coats.

I hooked mine up and raised it, so did the others, and in a flash that drab picket line burst ablaze with signs of all description. That spark of action and the splash of all those multicolored signs triggered our pent-up tension. We burst into a wild chant: "Hands off Haiti, Hands off Haiti." Then there was a rush and the police attacked us, the mounties in the lead.

The charge hit us broadside right where I was, a policeman on his horse slamming into us right in front of me, men and women trampled down by the horse, the policeman swinging down at them with his club. I heard a horse snort back of me, charging in, and I whirled. The horse was coming right at me. I was trapped, the sidewalk was too narrow to shift. The horse was going to trample me down! The horse was coming in fast, his snort bursting at my eardrum, the mountie standing in his stirrup, his club raised, two more steps and the charge would pin me right against the building. I raised my pole and thrust it in the face of the horse. The horse reared, jerking its head aside, and I side-stepped, grabbing for his bridle. It was high and I jumped for it when I was jarred by a terrific smash, the mounted policeman clubbed the placard right off its post. The swing carried him ahead of me, he half turned back in his saddle, he raised his club again, then lowered it to control his horse which was now rearing high on its hind legs to avoid smashing into the building. The horse was teetering, it was about to come down on me, and I blindly thrust up my pole to stick it into its flank but the horse avoided it and came down on all fours sideways, carrying the mountie away from me.

I was in a daze, trying to catch my breath, when a blinding pain exploded in my left shoulder. I swung around. It was a policeman on foot raising his club again when a third policeman smashed right into me and I was flying in the air, sailing into the street. I landed on my palms, toes, and one knee. I jumped up and the fight by now had by-passed me, the policemen were running ahead of me tackling what was left of the column which was all broken up. I saw Amter and a few others running toward the Elevated. I thought of following them but they were too far ahead for me to catch up. The large crowd of bystanders who had been held on the opposite sidewalk by the police now came swarming all over the pavement. It took me a few moments to realize I was now safe among them. My palms were sore and dirty black, the knuckles of my right hand were skinned, my spine and my shoulders were throbbing, my left arm felt paralyzed. The pain in my arm was agonizing, it was as if a red-hot iron rod had been rammed into the marrow of my bone. I moved my fingers, they were O.K.; I tested my arm, it could swing back and forth although the motion was excruciating; it could also move in a circle though I couldn't raise it, so it was not fractured.

The pain in my arm was centered in the biceps and it wouldn't let down, it was a stabbing ache and I was growing more and more angry. "The sonofabitches! The sonofabitches! They had no right to do that to me." The street was littered with torn placards. I looked for mine and found an irregularly torn piece of it. I picked it up. It now read:

<pre>
A  N  D
          F
H  A  I  T  I
</pre>

"And you, too!" I thought. I did not think it funny, I was bitter. I rolled up that torn piece and put it under my good arm, I don't know why, I believe as a sign that I hadn't surrendered.

I was making my way to the subway when I saw my unit organizer. She was still full of tension and I was glad she hadn't been hurt. She was talking a blue streak in her excitement but I wasn't listening, I kept repeating over and over to myself, "The sonofabitches! The sonofabitches!" Then I heard the unit organizer ask me again:

"What is it you said you wanted to tell me after the demonstration, Comrade?"

I looked at her and remembered, and came out with it. But it wasn't the speech I had so carefully rehearsed that morning, not even remotely like it.

"What is our damn unit doing besides attending meetings?" I asked her grimly. "I want to be really doing something, be real active."

She told me about the long-range project the unit had, the organizing of a laundry. They had been working on that on and off for months but she couldn't get the other comrades to help her systematically, they were too busy with their other meetings. We discussed the problem and we agreed right there and then that we would distribute leaflets in front of that laundry next Wednesday immediately we got off work. She would bring the leaflets, she had them at her home. That was just fine with me. "The sonofabitches! I'll show them yet .... I spent half of that night nursing my arm, it was painful far beyond anything I had ever experienced. I couldn't call a doctor, he would have had to report me to the police.

I was learning, learning on my skin and bone, that authority could arbitrarily draw a line in utter disregard of constitutional guarantees, in violation of free speech, free assembly, and woe to him who dared challenge that arbitrary action. But I also learned that those unlawful acts can be challenged and must be challenged, otherwise those rights would be lost by default. Personally I was for challenging it; I was in the Party to stay.

I wasn't quite sure what was going on in Haiti, but we had a right to voice our protest. No harm would have been done had they let us demonstrate; they could have let us parade up and down, let us listen to Amter, then have the police disperse us as they had in Washington. We hadn't provoked violence, we hadn't started it. The police had started the violence, they were the ones who had invoked it and used it. We had offered no resistance except in self-defense. I decided that the next time I would want a sharpened pole to take along with me.

Violence is a double-action weapon. Some people may be clubbed away, some people may be clubbed right back. I did not know it then but that bit of unjustified police violence was to make a Communist organizer out of me, a professional revolutionary, as Lenin had advocated way back in 1908.

"The sonofabitches! The sonofabitches! And just when I was quitting the Party for good!"
