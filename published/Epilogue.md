Communism creates its own antibodies. There is but one group of people in the entire world who are totally immune to all threats and blandishments from Moscow or Peking—the former Communists. Paradoxically, there are far more of us inside the iron curtain than out and our numbers are growing by the day. The red rulers fear us more than all other of their foes combined; more of us have suffered death and torture at their hands than all the Communists executed by Hitler, Mussolini, and other Fascist dictators. The people who participated in the demonstrations in Poland; the men, women, and children who manned the barricades in Budapest in 1956, were led by our political blood brothers, the former Communists. Because of our experiences we are the most implacable foes of totalitarianism and the greatest allies in the fight for liberty—a fact recognized in all lands yet blindly ignored in the United States.

It is an axiom that the demands raised by the revolutionaries of yesterday may well be the low norms of the morrow. The revolutionary demand of $15 a week unemployment compensation for which my skull had once been nearly split in two is by now way below the standard established in most states. The revolutionary demand of fifty cents an hour minimum wage, for which I had been roughly handled and driven out of town at pistol point in Yorkville, Ohio has long been raised to one dollar an hour by a Republican administration, no less.

All nations need their quota of rebels to goad them into enacting those social reforms that are essential to their progress. Stagnation and decadence invite disaster, for the Goths and Vandals are forever lurking outside the gates in search for the breach in the crumbling walls.

For having been such a rebel as I was, about a million of my countrymen in all walks of life were made into whipping boys by every demagogue and professional patriot who deals in hate to further his political ambition; branded subversives by opponents of all progressive measures who are hell-bent to restore all evils of the past in their selfish greed. I have never committed a crime or been charged with one; nor was I ever arrested. I was never involved in spying nor even knew about it—and that applies to all but a minuscule percentage of us. The few involved in spying have either gone to jail or glory depending on who told on whom first. The Communist Party which I quit over twenty years ago has by now all but disintegrated. Yet, I and my fellow former rebels have been degraded to second-class citizens, denied even the right of serving our country in the capacities we are best fitted for because of a panicky law that demands a negative answer to this question:

<em>"Are you now or have you ever been a member of. . . ?"</em>

Panicky laws do not make for national security, especially when they themselves smack of totalitarianism. Nor can we depend for our national defense on the strength of our arms alone. We need ideological weapons also and trained men to use them—experts that are plentiful among former Communists.

Basically there are only three great revolutionary proclamations that exert the most profound influence on the mind. The <em>Communist Manifesto</em> is but one of them. The other two in historical order are:


<em>The Sermon on the Mount;</em>


<em>The Declaration of Independence.</em>


As a nation born of revolution and a professed Christian one we have a special claim on both of these. Why on earth should we panic when faced with the incendiary cry of revolt.

<em>Arise ye prisoners of starvation . . .</em>

Of all nations in the world we have the best claim to respond:

<em>Peace on Earth; Good Will toward Men;</em>

<em>All men are created equal with the unalienable right to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness!</em>


In this struggle of ideologies the odds are two to one in our favor if we are but bold enough to take advantage of it. Let us devote our diplomacy, our surpluses, our technological skill with our traditional democratic forbearance to the above aims. Let us persist in this endeavor for another few decades. We will then discover that we no longer have to fear the rising of those proletarians who, according to the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>, have <em>nothing to lose but their chains</em>.

There won't be any of them left!
